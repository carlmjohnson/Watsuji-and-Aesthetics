##Chapter 2. Anthropology and Method

###Ethics as first philosophy
Following René Descartes and the subjective turn in philosophy, it has become usual to regard epistemology as the “first philosophy.” This is evident in the very title of Descartes’ most famous work: _Meditations on First Philosophy In Which the Existence of God and the Distinction between the Soul and the Body are Demonstrated_. Whatever else Descartes though of himself as doing in his _Meditations_, it was clear that the bulk of his project consisted in applying the epistemology he had set out in the _Discourse on Method_. This methodological assumption of Descartes continues to have influence far beyond the small circle of those who accept his arguments for God or mind-body dualism. Thus it is widely taken for granted that a proper investigation into the nature of a particular discipline such as aesthetics must begin with an investigation into what Kant calls “the condition of the very possibility” of the discipline as a science. However, as natural as this starting point may seem, it is a historical aberration. Within the Western tradition the term “first philosophy” was originally coined by Aristotle to refer to the discipline now known as metaphysics. Hence it was widely accepted that an investigation into the nature of a discipline as a science could only be conducted once the _objects_ of that discipline had been properly categorized. 

In addition to these two approaches which can be broadly said to characterize ancient and modern first philosophy in the West, there is another tradition in the East of taking practical concerns as having primary significance. For classical Indian philosophers (_āstika_ and _nāstika_ alike), the primary questions to be resolved were soteriological, and out of these answers flowed quite sophisticated metaphysical, logical, and epistemic systems. However, for the ancient Chinese and the civilizations they influenced, the first questions to be resolved were ethical or political. For example, when Xunzi writes on _zhengming_ [正名][ch] (using language properly), he does so not from the metaphysical standpoint of Socrates, who worries that his definitions conform to the eternal Forms, nor from the epistemic standpoint of David Hume, who traces ideas back to their original impressions, but from the standpoint of the socio-political effects certain patterns of usage will have within society.

Turning then to the question of aesthetics, how should we begin our investigation? We might begin by relating aesthetics to knowledge and the question of how we as subjects obtain knowledge of it. We might begin by relating aesthetics to its objects and contrast the internal objects of experience with external objects of the world. We might begin by attempting to relate aesthetics to a larger soteriological or politico-ethical project. Of course, whichever approach we choose to employ to describe aesthetics will by necessity be “impure” and contain elements of the other approaches. However, I will argue that Watsuji Tetsurō was right to suggest that our first philosophy must be _ningen no gaku to shite no rinrigaku_ [人間の学としての倫理学][ja]--“the study of ethics as the study of human beings.” This approach retains the subjective turn’s focus on the human being as the starting point of inquiry, but at the same time, it suggests that we understand humankind not only as “the rational animal” and "the political animal" but also as “the ethical animal,” because human beings must be understood through their communities as well as through individuals.

Practice vs. Theory. Practice is the first wrung on the ladder.

Logic as first philosophy, 

Suppose, for example, that a critic insists that logic, not ethics, is philosophically prior. Surprisingly, this critic will find an implicit opponent in Aristotle, whose defense of the law of non-contradiction ultimately grounds out in the concerns of the community:

> There are some who, as we said, both themselves assert that it is possible for the same thing to be and not to be, and say that people can judge this to be the case. And among others many writers about nature use this language. But we have now posited that it is impossible for anything at the same time to be and not to be, and by this means have shown that this is the most indisputable of all principles.---Some indeed demand that even this shall be demonstrated, but this they do through want of education, for not to know of what things one should demand demonstration, and of what one should not, argues want of education. For it is impossible that there should be demonstration of absolutely everything (there would be an infinite regress, so that there would still be no demonstration); but if there are things of which one should not demand demonstration, these persons could not say what principle they maintain to be more self-evident than the present one.
>
> We can, however, demonstrate negatively even that this view is impossible, if our opponent will only say something; and if he says nothing, it is absurd to seek to give an account of our views to one who cannot give an account of anything, in so far as he cannot do so. For such a man, as such, is from the start no better than a vegetable.[^]

[^]: Aristotle, _Metaphysics_, tr. W. D. Ross. Book Γ, part 4. 

In other words, for Aristotle the ultimate grounds of logic as an metaphysical enterprise are the grounds of discourse among fellow human beings. [Λόγος][gr] is an account, and accounts are given among and between human beings. With the person who will not abide by the law of non-contradiction we cannot have a productive conversation, and so for that reason we may say that in a certain sense the communal understanding that allows for discourse must come even before logic in philosophical priority.

If this is the case for logic, it is also the case for epistemology as well. 

epistemological modals are oughts not cans.

### Ethics and _Rinrigaku_
For Watsuji, the study of ethics is, as its name in Japanese (_rinrigaku_ [倫理学][ja]) suggests, the study (学) of the patterns (理) of human relations (倫).§ Though Watsuji grounds his explanation in the Japanese language, a similar understanding of ethics can also be found in the West. Aristotle writes in the _Nicomachean Ethics_,

§§§Look this up in Morohashi. 

> moral virtue comes about as the result of habit, whence also its name (_ethike_) is one that is formed by a slight variation from the word _ethos_ (habit). [^]

[^]: Aristotle, _Nicomachean Ethics_, tr. W. D. Ross. Book II.1. 

In other words, even for the highly metaphysical Greeks, ethics is ultimately founded on the giving an account ([λόγος][gr]) of the [ἦθος][gr] of the community. For that reason, this study must begin with a hermeneutic understanding of the human being. 

<<<quote of Watsuji here>>>
W agrees but does his as rin+ri+gaku. 

It might, however, be objected that the study of 
Ah but is-ought problem. Cf. Sekine thinks he needs more transcendence.

Yeah, but he’s an existentialist, so whatever.

Re: Ri Aristotle agrees that ethos grounds logic.

Maybe it’s perverse to make ethics the first philosophy, being as how it should be the crown jewel that comes last, the goal, not the (hopefully uncontroversial) basis of further insights?…

Is ethics objective or subjective? Kant is subjective, because it depends on the subject’s intention not the consequences. Mill is objective, because it depends on the objective consequences, not the subject’s intentions. But for Kant, your duties are objective matter as is whether you as a subject comport to your duties correctly. And for Mill, what makes a consequence good is just that subject out there are pleased by it. So, Kant is objective and Mill is subjective. Clearly, this is a contradiction. So which is it? Either objectively subjective or subjectively objective…

 Etymology isn’t destiny, but it is history
	*	Defense of human interconnectedness can be a pri or a post, but etymology is somewhere in between.
	- But Watsuji goes beyond mere etymology in later chapters.
*	Funny (?) example: People want cellphones more than clean water.

- Emptiness
 Fundamental law

 Negation in Hegel vs. Emptiness in Buddhism

*	There are at least three senses of negation: Hegelian, Buddhist, teenage rebellion

* 空 = openness?

*	Emptiness is the theory that everything exists as a part/whole in two directions. In the downward direction, it is reducible to its parts. In the upwards direction, it is always a part of a greater whole. People are made of organs and cells, but their part of a society and world. Doing physiology works by going from parts to person, and doing psychology (well) works by going from society to person. Mind is the name for the motive force in the whole-part, and body is the name for the motive force in the part-whole.
	Cf. Reduction (down)/Construction (up)/Destruction (out)

*	Is emptiness reducible or not?

*	Is emptiness just the transcendent third term? Why not? Emptiness is creative in East Asian Buddhism. In Platonism, Becoming is creative because it is between Being and Nothing on the Great Chain of Beings.

	No, because emptiness is empty. That means it cannot be transcendent in Ames’s sense of defining the other without being defined. It is the absolute, but only a relative absolute, but THE relative absolute.

*	Negation as love. Love is about a “fusion of horizons” etc. as is Watsuji’s cleavage. The thing about fusing horizons is that no matter how far you go, you never meet the horizon.

* Jesus/Paul says that Love thy neighbor is a summary of commandments 6-10. This can be made to fit W under my definition of love.

 Seken
*	Watsuji is a theorist of the One and the Many, but unlike in Plotinus et al., for Watsuji, the One 人 is constructed out of the Many 間 to which it returns.

*	Does it make sense to criticize Watsuji as reciprocal in relations and also as too community heavy?

*	Is Watsuji secretly an egoist because I harm myself when I betray my 間/absolute/emptiness?
	Yes, but so what? Egoism is troublesome because it has a false picture of self. As long as you have the right picture of self, then things like “self-sacrifice” become possible as ways of reaffirming the self.

*	Hermeneutics is a dynamic interplay of reason (logos), praxis, and theoria. Cf. Watsuji’s threefold method. Double cf. the emphasis on shutai as subject of praxis.
	
	The reason the search for a logical basis for math was so unsatisfying is that mathematical axioms are not more fundamental than reason itself. Math combines axiom to make facts, but it’s all on the basis of reason.
