##Chapter 2. Anthropology and Method

###Ethics as first philosophy
Following René Descartes and the subjective turn in philosophy, it has become usual to regard epistemology as the “first philosophy.” This is evident in the very title of Descartes' most famous work: _Meditations on First Philosophy In Which the Existence of God and the Distinction between the Soul and the Body are Demonstrated_. Whatever else Descartes though of himself as doing in his _Meditations_, it was clear that the bulk of his project consisted in applying the epistemology he set out in the _Discourse on Method_. This methodological assumption of Descartes continues to have influence far beyond the small circle of those who accept his arguments for God or mind-body dualism. Thus it is widely taken for granted that a proper investigation into the nature of a particular discipline such as aesthetics must begin with an investigation into what Kant calls "the condition of the very possibility" of the discipline as a science. However, as natural as this starting point may seem, it is a historical aberration. Within the Western tradition the term "first philosophy" was originally coined by Aristotle to refer to the discipline now known as metaphysics. Hence it was widely accepted that an investigation into the nature of a discipline as a science could only be conducted once the objects of that discipline had been properly categorized. 

In addition to these two approaches which characterize ancient and modern philosophy in the West, there is another tradition in the East of taking practical concerns as having primary significance. For classical Indian philosophers, the primary questions to be resolved were soteriological, and out of these answers flowed quite sophisticated metaphysical and epistemic systems. However, for the ancient Chinese and the civilizations they influenced, the first questions to be resolved were ethical or political. For example, when Xunzi writes on _zhengming_ [正名][ch] (using words properly), he does so not from the metaphysical standpoint of Socrates, who worries that his definitions conform to the eternal Forms, nor from the skeptical standpoint of David Hume, who traces ideas back to their original impressions, but from the standpoint of the socio-political effects certain patterns of usage will have within society.

Turning then to the question of aesthetics, how should we begin our investigation? We might begin by relating aesthetics to knowledge and the question of how we as subjects obtain knowledge of it. We might begin by relating aesthetics to its objects and contrast the internal objects of experience with external objects of the world. We might begin by attempting to relate aesthetics to a larger soteriological or politico-ethical project. Of course, whichever approach we choose to employ to describe aesthetics will by necessity be "impure" and contain elements of the other approaches. However, I will argue that Watsuji Tetsurō was right to suggest that our first philosophy must be _ningen no gaku to shite no rinrigaku_ 人間の学としての倫理学--"the study of ethics as the study of humanity." This approach retains the subjectivist turn's focus on the human being, but at the same time, it suggests that we understand humankind not only as "the rational animal" but also as "the ethical animal."

 Watsuji is an existentialist still

 Etymology isn't destiny, but it is history
	*	Defense of human interconnectedness can be a pri or a post, but etymology is somewhere in between.
	- But Watsuji goes beyond mere etymology in later chapters.
*	Funny (?) example: People want cellphones more than clean water.

- Emptiness
 Fundamental law

 Negation in Hegel vs. Emptiness in Buddhism

*	There are at least three senses of negation: Hegelian, Buddhist, teenage rebellion

*	Emptiness is the theory that everything exists as a part/whole in two directions. In the downward direction, it is reducible to its parts. In the upwards direction, it is always a part of a greater whole. People are made of organs and cells, but their part of a society and world. Doing physiology works by going from parts to person, and doing psychology (well) works by going from society to person. Mind is the name for the motive force in the whole-part, and body is the name for the motive force in the part-whole.
	Cf. Reduction (down)/Construction (up)/Destruction (out)

*	Is emptiness reducible or not?

*	Is emptiness just the transcendent third term? Why not? Emptiness is creative in East Asian Buddhism. In Platonism, Becoming is creative because it is between Being and Nothing on the Great Chain of Beings.

*	Negation as love. Love is about a "fusion of horizons" etc. as is Watsuji's cleavage. The thing about fusing horizons is that no matter how far you go, you never meet the horizon.

 Seken
*	Watsuji is a theorist of the One and the Many, but unlike in Plotinus et al., for Watsuji, the One 人 is constructed out of the Many 間 to which it returns.

*	Does it make sense to criticize Watsuji as reciprocal in relations and also as too community heavy?

*	Is Watsuji secretly an egoist because I harm myself when I betray my 間/absolute/emptiness?
	Yes, but so what? Egoism is troublesome because it has a false picture of self. As long as you have the right picture of self, then things like “self-sacrifice” become possible as ways of reaffirming the self.

*	Hermeneutics is a dynamic interplay of reason (logos), praxis, and theoria. Cf. Watsuji’s threefold method. Double cf. the emphasis on shutai as subject of praxis.
	
	The reason the search for a logical basis for math was so unsatisfying is that mathematical axioms are not more fundamental than reason itself. Math combines axiom to make facts, but it's all on the basis of reason.
