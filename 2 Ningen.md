##Chapter 2. Anthropology and Method

###Ethics as first philosophy
Having raised the question of subjectivity and objectivity in aesthetics, how should we begin our investigation? I will argue that [Watsuji][sc] Tetsurō was right to suggest that our first philosophy must be _ningen no gaku to shite no rinrigaku_ [人間の学としての倫理学][ja]---“the study of ethics as the study of human beings”---and that this must be the grounding for our theory of aesthetics. To understand what good aesthetics are, we must first understand who is doing it and why. Immanuel Kant famously concludes his _Critique of Pure Reason_ with three questions---“What can I know? What ought I to do? What may I hope?”---to which he later adds a fourth---“What is a human being?”[^] Though the questions are hopelessly intertwined the fourth may be said to contain the other three. Through a philosophical anthropology, we learn what we as human beings may know, what we ought to do as the sort of beings which we are, and what aspirations are rational for us to have.

[^]: The three questions appear in the _Critique of Pure Reason_ on B 832--3. The fourth question is added in the _Logic_ (Ak. IX, 25).

In this chapter, I will use Watsuji’s philosophical anthropology to show that our understanding of aesthetics must begin from the proposition that human beings exist not as substantive individuals nor as parts of an organic, substantive social whole, but in the emptiness between these two poles. The fundamental law of human beings is to dynamically negate these two moments of human existence. Accordingly, our investigation of aesthetics must proceed on the grounds of a hermeneutic inquiry that reduces, reconstructs, and deconstructs the moments of unity, division, and union in our existence.

Where Watsuji’s approach differs from many of his Western forebears is the picture of the human being he begins with. Watsuji suggests we understand humankind not only as “the rational animal” or “the political animal” but also as “the moral animal,” because human beings must be understood both through their communities and through the individuals in those communities. In a sense, accounts of human beings as the rational animal or the political animal are ultimately also accounts for human beings as the moral animal. As rational, we give accounts to one another, and the accounts we give are expected to be truthful ones because of our nature as moral and concerned with truth. As political, we live together in community, and what makes this life possible are the human virtues.[^] The advantage of the approach that begins with ethics as its root is that it retains the practical dimension of aesthetics as its basis of judgment. Although [Wang][sc] Yangming’s ([王陽明][ch], 1472--1529) version of Confucianism never achieved the status of orthodoxy, his slogan---_zhi xing he yi_ [知行合一][ch], “Unity of knowledge and practice”---is representative of a broader current of thinking throughout East Asian thought.[^] Coming in the twentieth century, Watsuji culturally inherited this tendency of thought, and in his mature writings, its explicit defense is a recurring theme. We engage in aesthetic practices together for purposes both communal and individual---that is, we make both collective judgments as an art world while forming personal tastes as individuals. Our knowledge of aesthetics is mediated through our practices as individuals embedded communities.

[^]: See the appendix to _Ethics_ for an extended discussion by Watsuji of how [ἀρετή][gr]/*virtus*/_de_ [德][ch]/virtue functions in all cases as forms of excellence that make a particular community possible. So, for example, the Platonic virtues of justice, moderation, courage, and wisdom were necessary for life in the polis and the contemporary virtues of liberty, equality, and fraternity are necessary for a democratic polity.
[^]: Cf. [Nishida][sc] Kitarō, _An Inquiry Into the Good_, 90, “as in Wang Yangming’s emphasis on the identity of knowledge and action, true knowledge is always accompanied by the performance of the will. To think in a certain way but not to desire in the same way means that one does not yet truly know.”

As Watsuji writes in his masterwork _The Study of Ethics_ (_Rinrigaku_ 倫理学), whatever topic we pursue will be in the end a topic of _human_ inquiry:[^]

[^]: Included in volume ten of _The Collected Works of Watsuji Tetsurō_ (_Watsuji Tetsurō Zenshu_ [和辻哲郎全集][ja]), abbreviated WTZ 10 hereafter. Translations mine, but the reader is invited to compare Carter and Yamamoto. 

> [S]cience (_gakumon_ [学問][ja]) and inquiry (_toi_ [問い][ja]) are both the behavior of humans, not isolated observers. Science is a relationship (_aidagara_ [間柄][ja]) of pursuit. The “thing” pursued subsists in common publicly within the relationships of human beings. That is, inquiry is fundamentally (根本的) “human inquiry.” […] A person could try to question a natural object in isolation from human connections alone in one’s study. However, should he, how will he escape the state of affairs that this is _in extremis_ a human inquiry? When he discusses the question with another pursuer, he has already placed the inquiry into the human realm as a communal (_kyōdō_ [共同][ja]) inquiry. (WTZ 10:32)

It should be clear to the reader how much more this applies in the case of aesthetics.

In spite of having made this brief argument for philosophical anthropology as first philosophy and human beings as communal, practical, and active, the reader should, I hope, retain a certain degree of skepticism about whether *any* approach to first philosophy can be ultimately satisfying. Perhaps even the term “first philosophy” betrays too much of a foundationalist bias in its conception. Here again, Watsuji will agree, insisting that our method in “the study of ethics as the study of human beings” be a hermeneutic one. Accordingly, while our investigation of aesthetics must begin by studying human beings as communal and ethical beings, it is not enough to try set forth initial “unhypothetical” first principles and proceed from there. Rather, we must continually revisit and refine our understanding as our investigation becomes deeper.

### Ethics and _Rinrigaku_
In order to posit “the study of ethics as the study of human beings” (_ningen no gaku to shite no rinrigaku_ [人間の学としての倫理学][ja]) as first philosophy necessary for the study of aesthetics, we must first clarify what this means somewhat, although a full clarification may not be possible without a complete account. For Watsuji, the study of ethics is, as its name in Japanese (_rinrigaku_ [倫理学][ja]) suggests, the study ([学][ja]) of the patterns ([理][ja]) of human relations ([倫][ja]).

As he writes in his _Study of Ethics_,

> The word “ethics” (_rinri_ [倫理][ja]) is made from two words: _rin_ [倫][ja] and _ri_ [理][ja]. _Rin_ means “fellows” (_nakama_ [なかま][ja]). “Fellows” is both the group as the relational system of specified persons and the individual persons who are prescribed by the group. […] It follows that _rin_ means “fellows” and also a specified form of conduct linkages (_kōi-teki renkan_ [行為的連関][ja]). As a result, _rin_ comes to mean a “pattern,” “form,” or “order” in human existence. (WTZ 10:12--3)

According to Morohashi’s _Dai Kan-Wa Jiten_, the meaning of the character [倫][ch] as “fellows” and derivatively their order can be seen even in the _Shuowen_ dictionary of the Han Dynasty, where [倫][ch] is defined the social classes of the human way. _Mencius_ 3A.4 lists what came to be known in Japan as _gorin_ [五倫][ja], the five key relationships: parent to child, ruler to vassal, husband to wife, elder to younger, and friend to friend. These relationships are general patterns which we must flesh out with particular content and meaning for our lives.

Alternatively, _rinrigaku_ is sometimes contrasted with _dōtokugaku_ [道徳学][ja], or “moral philosophy.” _Dōtoku_ (“moral”) is the Japanese transliteration of what is _daode_ in modern Mandarin Chinese, the same as the title of the _Daodejing_ [道德經][ch] attributed to Laozi. Much has been written about how best to translate this title into English, but roughly speaking, it concerns particular excellences or virtues (_de_) as they are situated within the broader ways or fields (_dao_) around them.[^] This too reflects the core concern with finding a pattern or ordering woven into the fabric of our existence.

[^]: See Ames and Hall, _Dao De Jing “Making This Life Significant”: A Philosophical Translation_, pp. 13--5 for more on the interpretation of the title.

Though Watsuji grounds his explanation of “ethics” in the Japanese language, an etymologically analogous understanding can also be found in the West. Aristotle writes in the _Nicomachean Ethics_,

> moral virtue comes about as the result of habit, whence also its name ([ἠθική][gr]) is one that is formed by a slight variation from the word [ἔθος][gr] (habit). [^]

[^]: Aristotle, _Nicomachean Ethics_, tr. W. D. Ross. Book II.1. 

In other words, ethics is ultimately founded on the giving an account ([λόγος][gr]) of the way of life ([ἦθος][gr]) of the community. A similar story can be told about “morals” and their relationship to social “mores.”[^] Accordingly, our study of aesthetics must begin with a hermeneutic understanding of the ethical patterns of human beings if it is going to be fully philosophically grounded.

[^]: The _Oxford English Dictionary_ writes, “Classical Latin *mōrālis* was formed by Cicero (_De Fato_ ii. i) as a rendering of ancient Greek [ἠθικός][gr] (*mōrēs* being the accepted Latin equivalent of [ἤθη][gr]).”

It may be objected that the study of the patterns of human relation becomes no more than a mere sociology or physical anthropology if it does not go beyond what actually is. Surely ethics cannot rest at merely describing how a community happens to be in a given place and time. It must also describe how the community _ought_ to be. Yet, the objection goes, so long as ethicists focus exclusively on the observable, they will never understand normativity. Worse still, a theory of aesthetics that proceeds from a similar ground will be no more than a popularity contest and make merely sociological observations about the state of public taste.[^]

[^]: Compare Komar and Melamid’s (possibly satirical?) project *The People’s Choice* in which the “most wanted” and “least wanted” paintings and songs were created by polling people’s preferences via survey. The results are predictably awful. 

Watsuji himself acknowledges this problem, but sought to overcome it by emphasizing the dynamic aspect of ethics as a practice that both is and is not realized in our world:

> [E]thics is none other than the order or path (_michi_ [道][ja]) through which human communal existence is brought into being as itself. In other words, ethics is the law (_rihō_ [理法][ja]) of social existence. 
>
> However, does this mean that ethics is already apparently realized as the ought? Yes and no. (WTZ10:13–4)

Ethics _is_ already realized because what ought to be is the authenticity of what already is, yet it _is not_ yet realized, for that authenticity is still a limiting horizon rather than an actual reality. So too, it is absurd to exclude public taste as an informant of our understanding of aesthetics, just as it is absurd to elevate popularity to our sole criterion of aesthetic excellence.

Broadly speaking, if one may classify existential ethics as the tendency of thinkers to hang their metaethics on the principle that an action is right if and only if it is an authentic expression of one’s being, then Watsuji’s ultimate metaethics may be characterized as existential. However, authenticity for Watsuji evolves within a broader historical, geographical, and social context while also shaping that context. As Hall and Ames write in _Thinking Through Confucius_,

> The existentialist perspective can be adjusted toward classical Confucianism only to the extent that it recognizes the relativity of the individual with respect to the society that determines, as well as is determined by, him. (14)

As we shall see, this aptly describes the sort of modification that Watsuji has made to existentialism.

###The Twofold Character of Human Existence
The starting point of Watsuji’s anthropology is the recognition of this codetermination of the individual and society. Too often philosophers have taken society as no more than the aggregation of individuals, and so attempted to treat it as subordinate to our nature as individuals. As he begins his _Study of Ethics_:

> The primary significance of the attempt to define ethics as the study of “human beings” (*ningen* 人間) is its getting away from the misunderstanding of the modern world which takes ethics as simply a problem of the individual consciousness. This misunderstanding is founded on the modern individualistic view of humanity. Our grasp of the individual, itself a product of the spirit of modernity, holds a great significance which we must never forget, but individualism tried to take the individual, which is one moment in human existence, and substitute it for the human totality. Its abstractness became the root of every kind of misunderstanding. The standpoint of the isolated ego, which is the starting place of modern philosophy, is none other than one example of this. (WTZ 10:11)

&nbsp;

As useful as the Cartesian doubt was as an impetus toward the subjective turn in philosophy, ultimately, it was mistaken. Even a recluse or a Robinson Crusoe has to have been a member of some society at one time in the past in order to develop into a self-sufficient individual adult; unlike other species, human infants are not self-sufficient. Making the individual the core unit of our analysis deliberate ignores important facts about how human beings survive as a species. Thus, according to Watsuji, although the modern subjective turn often begins with an examination of the limits of individual existence,

> if a person is authentically a social animal, then things like our relationships (*aidagara* [間柄][ja]) and society should not be separated from the person. It must be the case that persons are something that while capable of being individually are also capable of being socially. And what displays this twofold characteristic best is the word *ningen* [人間][ja] (“human being”). (WTZ 10:16)

In other words, we cannot think of human beings as first isolated individuals who then somehow become entangled in social relationships. On the other hand, we should not think of society as a kind of super-organism of which the individual is a mere part. Instead we must think of these relationships as having equal priority to our individuality. Our relationships are just as authentic a part of us as our individuality and vice versa. This shows a basic twofold character of the human being as both individual and collective. In Japanese, the English word “human being” is translated as _ningen_ [人間][ja]. It is written with two characters. The first, _nin_ [人][ja], can also be read as _hito_ and means “person” or “someone.” The second, _gen_ [間][ja], can also be read as _aida_, _ma_, or _ken_ and means a spatial or temporal interval. The term _ningen_ gained currency in the Japanese language as a Buddhist term meaning the “human realm” as distinct from the other realms of rebirth, such as the animal world or the various hells and heavens.[^] Watsuji finds it telling that over time this term could change in its meaning from a realm to humans collectively to humans individually. One might think that this is merely an artifact of the fact that neither Japanese nor Chinese grammatically require a sharp distinction between singular and plural, but according to Watsuji, its significance is much greater. For him, the multiple usages of _ningen_ are a linguistic expression of an underlying truth about humankind as both particular ([人][ja]) and relational ([間][ja]). We are both discrete ([人][ja]) and continuous ([間][ja]). Such a usage could not have gained currency in the Japanese language if it did not reflect something of the truth about the human condition.

[^]: The characters [人][ch] and [間][ch] seem to have first come into use together during the Warring States or Han Dynasty period of Chinese history, where they meant something like “being among others in society.” Dating texts from that period can be fraught with controversy, so it is difficult to assign priority of usage, but it can be found in _Zhuangzi_, _Leizi_, _Shuo Yuan_, _Guanzi_, etc.

One might object (and this objection applies as well to our earlier examination of the origins of the words “ethics” and “morals”) that these sort of Heideggerian etymological insights, however interesting, are ultimately a matter of merely historical curiosity, and no philosophical consequences can be drawn from them. Furthermore, Watsuji seems to invest in Japanese etymology a particular importance over and above that of other languages, claiming for instance that:

> I suppose this inclination [to individualism] is believed to be based on how the words _anthrōpos_, _homo_, man, _Mensch_, etc. are only able to mean an individual person. (WTZ 10:16)

&nbsp;

> We [Japanese] possess the word _ningen_ which is deeply significant in this way. On the basis of its significance, we created a concept of the human being. Human beings _are_ “in the world” (_yo no naka_ [世の中][ja]) while they _are_ also “persons” in that world. (WTZ 10:17)

In other words, Watsuji is showing a certain degree of chauvinistic pride in the seeming uniqueness of the meaning of the word _ningen_ vs. its western equivalents. However, in considering the general neglect of Japan by Western philosophers, we should perhaps be understanding of a certain degree of patriotic self-congratulation even as we condemn excesses of the myth of Japanese uniqueness (_nihonjinron_ 日本人論).

To be sure, etymology is not destiny; just because a word came from a certain source historically, that does not imply that the word will continue to have an equivalent meaning henceforth or that the original meaning of a word is its “true meaning” in exclusion of its later uses. Nevertheless, there are problems with pressing this objection too strongly. First, it presumes that the historical patterns by which language changes are haphazard and produce no information through their evolution. To the contrary, however, if we believe that language is a tool of human thought, we should expect that the evolution of this tool will be in a direction that tends to maximize its practicality for human purposes, just as other human tools tend to evolve in useful directions (though not necessarily always).

Second, this objection presumes that linguistic evolution as _a posteriori_ cannot inform philosophy which conducts its investigations _a priori_. Laying aside the full scope of the difficulties with precisely demarcating these categories, let us merely observe that it is not clear that etymology is simply _a posteriori_. “All bachelors are unmarried” is an analytic proposition because of the meaning of the word “bachelor,” but meanings are things that change historically. If “water is H<sub>2</sub>O” is anything like analytic (a topic of some debate), it has become so through a process of etymological evolution. As science has evolved, we have chosen to adopt the meaning “substance composed of (mostly) H<sub>2</sub>O” for “water,” in spite of the fact that the liquids we common call water also contain hydroxyl ion, free hydrogen, dissolved gasses, various minerals, microorganisms, etc., etc. and in preference to less “scientific” definitions such as “a clear, drinkable liquid.”[^] It should be fairly uncontroversial that the evolution of the meaning of the word water has been towards something like a better understanding of what properties are essential for a substance to have if it is to be considered water _for our practical purposes_. Knowledge of the “essence” (the “what it is”) of a thing is gained through experience as well as ratiocination. Through an understanding of etymology, we can see the sort of adaptations and uses that human beings have found appropriate for words, and in doing so we understand them better. Hence, by learning how ethics has evolved from ethos or _rinrigaku_ from ordered relations, we learn something about how what sorts of meanings are contained in them. So too, the evolution of _ningen_ as the Japanese word for human being conveys information that can be applied beyond a Japanese context.

[^]: See Zemach, Eddy M., “Putnam’s Theory on the Reference of Substance Terms.” _The Journal of Philosophy_, Vol. 73, No. 5 (Mar. 11, 1976), pp. 116-127, for a cogent criticism of Hillary Putnam on this point.

Indeed, as Watsuji explains, words themselves have a structure that illustrates the twofold character of human beings as individuals and collective, _nin_/_gen_:

> Incidentally, what we call words are one of the most uncanny things among what has been made by humans. Whatever person we should speak of, no person can be said to make words by herself, and yet words are for each person her own words. This kind of character that words have is caused by their being the furnace through which human subjective (_shutai-teki_ [主体的][ja]) linkages are turned into noematic meanings. Said in other words, they are the making conscious of pre-conscious existence. (WTZ10:12)

On the one hand, words are a mechanism by which the “blooming buzzing confusion” of pre-conscious pure experience is converted into reflective consciousness. This is surely a paradigmatically individual moment in the process of experience. Yet at the same time what mediates this moment of individual experience are words which have come to the individual through the community. Words are for each of us our own words, yet our words are always the words of the others who gave them their beginnings of meaning in the distant etymological past. 

###Emptiness, Betweenness, and the Fundamental Law of Human Beings
<!--Make sure this section stays aesthetic!§-->
The double nature of words as individually and collectively possessed vividly illustrates Watsuji’s contention that,

> Individual persons *do not subsist* in themselves. […] *Neither does* a total agent *subsist* in itself. […] It follows that individual persons subsist in a linkage with totality. […] It follows that we must find that the total agent as well *subsists* in a linkage with the independence of individuals. (WTZ 10:106)

It may seem strange to assert that individual persons do not subsist in themselves. Common sense in the modern West tells us that individuals are ontologically prior to the communities which they choose to form through a social contract. However, in the chapter “Moments of Individualism in Human Existence,” Watsuji searches for this ontologically prior individual without success. We may try to think of the human body as an independent physical substance, but this way of thinking clashes with our everyday experience. As Watsuji illustrates, 

> When we spot a friend waiting for us by a bronze statue, it’s not that we find as an immediately given fact a solid object with the same form as the statue. From the first, we *find our friend*. (WTZ 10:68)

We discover the person of our friend and not a mere object, yet this does not occur through some inferential process by which observe the object of our friend and then conclude that there must be an invisible soul animating her body. Rather, “the motion of the subjective body (_shutai_ [主体][ja]) is the motion of the physical body, without the slightest gap between the subjective and physical bodies” (WTZ 10:68). As we push ahead in our investigation of the human body, we discover its existence as an acting subject, but as an acting subject, our bodies are linked in relationships. I see *my friend* by the statue. I greet *the driver* as I get on board the bus. I watch *a stranger* walk passed me on the sidewalk. As subjects, our bodies are already connected in a web of relationships and roles. The more we continue investigating the acting subjects around us, the more we find our supposed independence from them vanishes:

> To the degree that it is able to form relationships, the physical body is something connected to other physical bodies; to the degree that its connection to other bodies is exhaustively destroyed, it either returns to being *a solid object unable to form relationships* or it returns to *absolute emptiness*. (WTZ 10:71)

Hence our individuality as subjects cannot ground out in our independence as physical objects without either cutting off our personhood or admitting the emptiness of individuality itself.

If this is so, perhaps we should look for our individuality in the mind rather than the body. However, there too our search fails. Language is a core aspect of thought, yet as we have already seen, the language *I* use is inevitably the language *we* use, because words are both individual and communal. Watsuji writes,

> For example, [the independence of consciousness] is like thinking of the self that sees the wall when one is alone in one’s study looking at a wall all by oneself. However, if in this case one is conscious of *the wall as a wall*, social consciousness has already infiltrated into it. (WTZ 10:77)

The aspectival nature of perception means that ordinary consciousness is far from independent. Rather, it utilizes the concepts and categories which it receives from others. Moreover, even for wordless feelings, my consciousness is connected with the consciousness of the other:

> It cannot be that my consciousness which feels the beauty of a picture and the consciousness of Thou towards the same picture are completely independent things. We are feeling the same beauty together. The difference in the way that two people feel can only be compared on the ground of this shared feeling. (WTZ 10:76)

If even my private feelings of aesthetic satisfaction or dissatisfaction are shared with others, what is left of my individuality? All we can say is that our individuality is a kind of limit that we reach when we take a contextual field of relationships and attempt to remove that context in order to focus more tightly on the central locus of those relationships. But, like the axis around which a top spins, there is nothing in that center point which can account for the motion swirling around it, and too close of a focus on it will only mislead us. Watsuji concludes,

> It follows that individuality itself has no established existence; *its essence is negation and is emptiness*. (WTZ 10:85)

&nbsp;

Having negated the individual as a substantial entity, one may then hypothesize that some sort of super-individual self is ontologically prior, and individual human beings are just parts of this communal or social whole. However, Watsuji also denies this supposition. In the chapter “Moments of Totality in Human Existence,” Watsuji finds that communal wholes are just as lacking in substantiality as the individual whole was. The difficulty is that there is no singular super-individual whole to which an individual belongs. The same person may be both a father _and_ a son. One person can be both a wife *and* a citizen or a worker *and* a student. The result of this multiplicity of non-overlapping identities is that, “the manner of manifesting the whole is entirely different from the manner in which a hand, as part of the body, manifests the whole” <!--§-->(90). A hand is just a part made of parts, but a human being plays many different parts in many different relationships.[^]

[^]: Incidentally, this is the reason it is strictly speaking inaccurate to classify Watsuji as a totalitarian as is sometimes done. While this is no defense of Watsuji’s overall political beliefs, it should be noted that strictly speaking Watsuji does not believe that human beings only have meaning within a larger totality which is self-evidently meaningful.

As the result of his investigation of the various attempts to understand the totality of which the individual is supposedly just a part, Watsuji concludes that, “something whole that precedes individuals and prescribes them as such, namely, such a thing as ‘the great whole,’ does not really exist” (99).<!--§-->

Since neither individuals nor “society” as a totality have truly independent existence, this means that they are both “empty” in the sense of lacking an independent substantiality not derived from a more fundamental relationality. In other words,

> If we take this to be so, then both the individual person and the totality are things *which do not subsist in themselves but merely subsist in their linkage with the other*. (WTZ 10:106)

At an ultimate level, to be an individual is to be a part of a larger whole, and to be a larger whole is to be made up of various individuals. Both the individual and the whole exist within a larger field of possible relationships, and, “Neither one nor the other has ‘precedence’ ” (102).<!--§-->

Watsuji explains the reason this search for substantiality failed is that it is only by putting “betweenness” or the fixed relationships (_aidagara_ 間柄) of person and person first ontological that we can solve the nagging problem of subject and object relations. _Aidagara_ is written using the same character, [間][ja], as the _gen_ in _ningen_, which, as mentioned above indicates a spatial or temporal interval. _Aidagara_, then, is a kind of field or space in which our persistent relationships with others take place. This field is what has ontological priority, not the objects thought to be contained within it. Shogakukan’s _Ruigo Jiten_ Japanese thesaurus notes that unlike the word _kankei_ [関係][ja], which is also often translated as “relationship,” _aidagara_ indicates a fixed relationship, hence one would not use it in expressions like, “lose one’s relationship” or “break off the relationship” as one would with _kankei_. _Aidagara_ are persistent relations---such as familial bonds---which cannot be severed merely through a change of attitude or circumstance. Recall the five relationships, or _gorin_, of Confucianism. In our lives, these relations proceed our existence (one cannot exist as a child without some relation to a parent), but we also play a part in creating, sustaining, and redefining these relationships (a parent cannot be a parent without having had a child). 

Applying this insight at the level of ethics, Watsuji finds the “fundamental law of human beings” is that individuals must negate the totality to which they belong in order to individuate themselves but they must negate that negation in order to return to the totality. He writes,

> Totality is said to arise in the negation of individuality, but it is not able to appear in through the negation of the individual alone. Individuals are the many, and the totality as community existence arises at the point where these many individuals become one by forsaking their individuality. But in any totality whatsoever, individuality is not extinguished without residue. As soon as an individual is negated, it negates the totality so as to become an individual once more.[…] Totality subsists only in this movement. (23)

In other words, human existence is fundamentally a dynamic process in which we are never frozen into a static existence as self-defined individuals or socially constructed roles.  When we act, we act in conformance to society or in opposition to society and through acting, we redefine ourselves and the roles society has for us. Neither totality nor individuality has substantial existence alone, but both come into being through dynamic opposition. 

For Watsuji, this dynamic process of interplay between the self as individual and the self as communal is the source of human authenticity.

For this reason, they can be said to be empty. <!--non dual-->

§But what is negation?
> Hence, individuality does not have an independent existence. Its essence is negation, that is, emptiness. 80
> That is to say, in the extremity in which we examine the individual independence of a body, we reach a point at which individual independence perishes. This is what in Buddhism is described as “the dropping off of body-mind.” 67§ … That is to say, the subjective body terminate in absolute emptiness, when its individuality is carried to the extreme. This is a real feature and characteristic of the individuality of the human body. §68
§§ Sakai’s criticisms of this as baked over Hegel. My theory of negation as love.


§The thing negated is emptiness itself:

> Seen in this way, the individual is one who becomes an individual as the negation of **emptiness from which the self originates (本源)** (that is, authentic emptiness). WTZ10:124

> _ningen sonzai_ is an incessant movement in which one becomes an individual by departing somewhat from the communal and then negating this individuality and bringing to realization the community in one way or another, so as to return to one’s authenticity. 186 = WTZ 10: 195

“Movement of negation” = movement from an established aidagara (the current community) to a possible one. 

> That is to say, an established betweenness is, in its extreme, the absolute wholeness that consists of the nonduality of the self and the other; that is, the authentic countenance prior to the birth of one’s parents, as is said in Zen Buddhism. In other words, it is authenticity as the ground out of which we, fundamentally speaking, come forth. 
>
> At the same time, possible betweenness is absolute wholeness, which also consists of the nonduality of the self and the other. 187

> This authenticity is the source of the “self,” and at the same time, the “self” comes to be established only as the negation of this authenticity.
>
> The negation of authenticity is inauthenticity. What Heidegger calls _authenticity_ is, in reality, inauthenticity. And when this in-authenticity becomes further negated through the nondual relation of self and other, that is to say, when the “self” becomes annihilated, on then is authenticity realized. 
>
> Looking backward from this perspective, we are now able to call this totality of _ningen_ the _authentic self_. But the authentic self in this case is the superindividual subject, as in Kant, and not an individual self that becomes a totality through death, as in Heidegger. […] For these reasons, the authentic self must consist in the nondual relation of the self and other. 225

Great quotes about the “return” to our authentic home country in WTZ10:195

We may say then that human beings are “empty.” However, like negation, emptiness has several relevant interpretations, and Watsuji perhaps means to indicate all of them in his use of the term. 


When we look back at the problem of subject-object relations in aesthetic experience with Watsuji’s insights in mind, we see that the question of whether the object is beautiful or it is the subject who sees the object as beautiful assumes a separation of subject and object that may not correspond to reality. Watsuji has told us that the line between self and other is only indistinct. Might the same also be true of the line between subject and object? That is, if both the subject and object are artifacts of a more primordial betweenness, then any line drawn with the subject on one side and the object on the other will, in its being drawn, act to determine some of the qualities of the subject and object. The implications of this process will be explored in greater depth in the next chapter.

###Cleavages in everyday existence

> “It is” is none other than **an indication of the unity that has been self-realized (自覚) in division**. Yet, a proposition is something that reveals the self-awareness (自覚) of human existence in **the linkage of unity-division-union**. Incidentally, human existence itself is a movement that apparently realizes its authentic unity in the linkage of unity-division-union. WTZ10:39–40

The pattern of double negation in human existence can be subsumed under a more general pattern of hermeneutic cleavage: first there is an undifferentiated whole, then its division, and finally the reunion of the parts without a reversion to the origin. Watsuji calls this a realization of original unity “through the correlation of unity/division/union [_tōitsu/bunri/ketsugo_ 統一・分離・結合]” (37).  Because this pattern underlies human existence, the only way to come to understand the structure of the human being--and hence the possible grounds of aesthetics--is through “the hermeneutic method of reduction/construction/destruction [_kangen/kōsei/hakai_ 還元・構成・破壊]” (45). We reduce when we return to the moment of undivided unity in everyday experience. We construct when through action we differentiate through action a focus out of the field that surrounds it. Finally, we destroy or deconstruct when we reintegrate the focus into the field and recognize their union.

As illustrated by figure one, unity/division/union and reduction/construction/destruction are parallel to the pattern of double negation at work in human existence. As human beings, we come from a place of betweenness where there are no defined boundaries between self and other. There is a difference between our core and those around us (as symbolized by the gradient from black to white), but this difference is a vague one with no bright line of discontinuity, only opposing poles. This is the first phase, unity. Then in negation we carve out a space between our self and our surroundings. We oppose those around us and so define ourselves. We separate the content from its context, the focus from its field. This is the second phase, division. In the third phase, we bring self and other together in a union to form a community. As individuals, we reconcile ourselves to society. Notice, however, that the marks of cleavage remain even after this reunion. After this, the cycle continues again from unity as we continually define and redefine through action our relations with others and objects.

Because of this, our investigation of aesthetics must begin with a “reduction” (_kangen_ 還元, a return to the original unity) in which we grasp everyday experience as expressions of our existence. As Watsuji says,

> there is no mine so rich as that which is called the _everyday experience_ of human beings. Walking along the street we can find various goods on display shelves. Common sense already has some knowledge of how to classify, how to use, and why to buy them. In addition, there are none of these goods that does not give expression to [human existence] in one way or another. […] In other words, as expressions, what we call the _things of daily life_ all offer a passage to [human existence]. Therefore, we are able to take our departure from “facts,” taken in the most naïve and ordinary sense of the word. (39)

To be sure, should we merely observe the patterns of everyday existence without going any deeper, then aesthetics would be the mere study of public opinion--this kind of art is popular, this kind of is unpopular, some people like this, others do not, and so forth. We go beyond merely sociologically describing cultural patterns in aesthetics when we start to see how everyday experiences are expressions of a deeper structure of humanity and grasp that structure. Reduction is crucial to the understanding, but since human existence is a dynamic interplay between individuality and sociality, we cannot get a complete grasp of human existence through reductive reflection alone. We cannot, so to speak, understand aesthetics only from the armchair. A purely theoretical aesthetics would rapidly become disconnected from life as it is. We must also also live these expressions constructively while detaching ourselves from them if they are to go beyond static understanding into dynamic realization in space and time. Finally, through this preparation we are able to deconstruct our experiences and grasp the structure of the union in human existence.
