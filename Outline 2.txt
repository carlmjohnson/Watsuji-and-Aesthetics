- Bio:
 Confucian Doctor Dad, Romantics, Shaw, Koeber, Nietzsche, Kirkegaard, Soseki, Buddhism, Nishida, Heidegger, Marxists, War, Post-War

- Ethics as first philosophy:
 Ethics = Rin + Ri + Gaku
 Cf. Aristotle on ethos as root of logic
 Watsuji is an existentialist still

- Ningen
 Etymology isn't destiny, but it is history
	*	Defense of human interconnectedness can be a pri or a post, but etymology is somewhere in between.
	- But Watsuji goes beyond mere etymology in later chapters.
*	Funny (?) example: People want cellphones more than clean water.

- Emptiness
 Fundamental law

 Negation in Hegel vs. Emptiness in Buddhism

*	There are at least three senses of negation: Hegelian, Buddhist, teenage rebellion

*	Emptiness is the theory that everything exists as a part/whole in two directions. In the downward direction, it is reducible to its parts. In the upwards direction, it is always a part of a greater whole. People are made of organs and cells, but their part of a society and world. Doing physiology works by going from parts to person, and doing psychology (well) works by going from society to person. Mind is the name for the motive force in the whole-part, and body is the name for the motive force in the part-whole.
	Cf. Reduction (down)/Construction (up)/Destruction (out)

*	Is emptiness reducible or not?

*	Is emptiness just the transcendent third term? Why not? Emptiness is creative in East Asian Buddhism. In Platonism, Becoming is creative because it is between Being and Nothing on the Great Chain of Beings.

*	Negation as love. Love is about a "fusion of horizons" etc. as is Watsuji's cleavage. The thing about fusing horizons is that no matter how far you go, you never meet the horizon.

 Seken
*	Watsuji is a theorist of the One and the Many, but unlike in Plotinus et al., for Watsuji, the One 人 is constructed out of the Many 間 to which it returns.

*	Does it make sense to criticize Watsuji as reciprocal in relations and also as too community heavy?

*	Is Watsuji secretly an egoist because I harm myself when I betray my 間/absolute/emptiness?
	Yes, but so what? Egoism is troublesome because it has a false picture of self. As long as you have the right picture of self, then things like “self-sacrifice” become possible as ways of reaffirming the self.

 - Reduction(??)/Construction/Destruction

*	Hermeneutics is a dynamic interplay of reason (logos), praxis, and theoria. Cf. Watsuji’s threefold method. Double cf. the emphasis on shutai as subject of praxis.
	
	The reason the search for a logical basis for math was so unsatisfying is that mathematical axioms are not more fundamental than reason itself. Math combines axiom to make facts, but it's all on the basis of reason.
