##Chapter 1. The Problem of Aesthetic Subjectivity

###Problem of subjectivity and objectivity in aesthetic judgment
The central question in the study of aesthetics is the question of subjectivity. To put the question in its popular form, we wish to know whether “beauty is in the eye of the beholder” before we answer all of the other questions that arise about art, meaning, representation, form, and so on. This question is central because it is the axis around which turns our practical engagement with aesthetics: we experience beauty personally, we share our experience of beauty with others, and we create new beautiful things. In doing so, we wonder whether this beauty is really something separate from ourselves or just a golden mirror of our own pleasant dispositions. Without knowing this, all of our other aesthetic questions will have at their basis something unsure. But evocative though it may be, the meaning of this question as phrased is yet unclear (what could it mean to be in the eye of a beholder?), hence we must make some attempt at clarifying it before an initial answer can be suggested and the topic directly pursued.

Suppose that aesthetic judgment is completely subjective, such that statements of the form “That is beautiful” may be interpreted without loss as meaning “I find that to be beautiful.” In that case, no discussion about whether or not something is beautiful ought to arise, since my saying “That is beautiful” and your saying “That is not beautiful” are no more contradictory than my saying “I like licorice” and your saying “I do not like licorice.” To have a basis for disagreement, individual feeling is insufficient. There needs to be some common object of our disagreement. I believe that the object has one quality and you believe it has another. Through dialogue, we are able to resolve our disagreements and come to a mutual understanding of the qualities of the object. 

However, to posit that aesthetic judgment is completely objective is also quite problematic. First, despite no shortage of attempts, no one has been able to definitively specify the formal criteria of many of aesthetic predicates. While there have been many attempts to do so, none has gained consensus. This might not be so strange in itself (few things in the world have universally accepted definitions), but at the same time, individuals have no hesitance about expressing their personal feeling about whether a work does or does not exhibit the particular aesthetic predicates in some aesthetic judgment such as beauty or originality. We might attribute this social phenomenon to widespread ignorance or willingness to give an opinion without first obtaining a solid basis for rendering judgments, but we also have the experience of saying things like, “I understand why you think X is beautiful, but it just doesn’t ‘work’ for me.” In other words, we appeal to our feelings as individuals when discussing aesthetics though we just saw that individual feeling is an insufficient basis for discussion. Why should the public at large so persistently make such an elementary error in their reasoning about aesthetics? No one experiences the distance of the Sun from the Earth, but we all concur that it is around 93 million miles. The situation in aesthetics is almost completely reversed, with each individual experiencing the aesthetic predicate in question but none willing to accept a consensus viewpoint not directly experienced.

If we approach aesthetic judgment as a wholly subjective or individualistic matter, at least two problems result. First, as seen, without any common object shared by different participants in a discussion, it is not possible for any mutual discussion of aesthetics to take place. This is contradicted by our experience, in which aesthetics *is* fruitfully discussed, at least some of the time. Second, in the limit, there will be no ability for one to cultivate one’s aesthetic judgment, since there will be nothing outside of a momentary, subjective experience to appeal to in the cultivation of one’s taste.

If, on the other hand, we take the acquisition of good taste in aesthetic judgment to be a matter of conforming to wholly objective or collectivistic aesthetic canons, we also encounter at least two problems. First, that no canon has been universally accepted (though there are of course many historically and regionally specific canons of taste). This may be a merely epistemological difficulty on our part or some other sort of ordinary failing in our pursuit of aesthetic objectivity, but such a difficulty points to a second problem, which is that a wholly objective canon will be formally disconnected from the experience of personal assent or appreciation. If our explanation of aesthetic judgments and taste does not ground out in aesthetic experience, then something crucial has been lost. It seems impossible that something could be objectively beautiful yet disagreeable to all possible perceivers of the object. However without some link from objective beauty to the subject’s judgment of agreeability, such a possibility cannot be ruled out. 

To shed light on this discussion of aesthetic judgment, let us take simple factual judgments like, “This apple is red” or “The table is square.” Are these judgments objective or subjective? There are at least seven ways to interpret the question:

* (1) We might mean by “this apple is red” or “this table is square” that it _seems_ that way to me right now. I am having a reddish experience of the apple or a squarish experience of the table.

* (2) We might mean that I have a habitual experience of the seeming redness of this apple or the seeming squareness of this table. As I repeatedly interact with the object, I repeatedly have similar experiences of how the object seems to me.

* (3) Suppose that one is looking a quadrangular table from such an angle that it _appears_ as a square to one’s vision center. Under ordinary conditions, one would nevertheless perceive it aspectivally as quadrangular, since the human vision process naturally corrects for angles of perspective and causes us to experience a square table _as_ square even if it is seen from an angle that makes it seem non-square, and vice versa to see a non-square table as non-square even if it happens to form a square shape from one’s perspective. Similarly, a green apple might appear as reddish under a reddish light, but one’s vision will naturally correct for the apparent color of the apple so that it continues to be seen as green while appearing red.[^] (Normally, only artists are trained to notice the difference between how things seem aspectivally and how they appear non-aspectivally, but it can be noticed without any particular training.)

[^]: See, for example, Adelson’s checkerboard illusion in which two squares of the checker look like different colors though they are actually the same shade of gray: <`http://web.mit.edu/persci/people/adelson/checkershadow_illusion.html`>.∞

* (4) We might mean that the apple or table will seem red or square to any _suitable spectator_--that is, any time a “normal” human being with ordinary vision, stands a normal distance away under normal lighting conditions, etc., etc. that person will see these things as seeming red or square.

* (5) We might mean by red having a measurable _capacity_ to reflect light of approximately 630 to 740 nanometers in wavelength when exposed to light of the ordinary spectrum at ordinary intensities at ordinary temperatures, etc. (An apple may still be red in a dark room.) We might mean by square having the tendency to be found square when measured by a normal observer under normal conditions.

* (6) We might mean by red _currently_ emitting light of approximately 630 to 740 nanometers in wavelength or by square currently having an angle of ninety degrees at each of its four corners and sides of equal length, as measurable by some idealized rational observer.

* (7) The same meaning as (5) or (6) but _without regard_ for whether anyone will or could experience these facts. 

These seven interpretations have generally been arranged from those having more subjective involvement to those that are more objective, yet each is an equally acceptable as an interpretation of the natural language judgments in question. When considering whether aesthetic judgments are “subjective” or “objective,” it will be correspondingly difficult to answer in a univocal fashion. Let us try, for example, to examine corresponding interpretations of a judgment like, “Ice cream is delicious.”

* (1) We might mean by “ice cream is delicious” that the ice cream which I am eating now _seems_ that way to me right now.

* (2) We might mean that I habitually find that I tend to have an experience of deliciousness when eating ice cream.

* (3) We might mean that although I am not currently consciously feeling the deliciousness of the ice cream due to some other factor (for example, my attention is distracted from the ice cream or there is another flavor in my mouth from some other food mingling with the ice cream’s taste), the feeling that I am having is one consistent with the sort of experience I would have in an experience of delicious ice cream were I to attend to it properly.

* (4) We might mean that most normal human beings (given some criteria of suitability) who eat ice cream will experience deliciousness.

* (5) We might mean that the ice cream under discussion possesses a capacity to induce experiences of deliciousness.

* (6) We might mean that ice cream has a molecular make up (sugars and fats and what not) that we may call scientifically delicious, because any food possessing such a make up will also tend to be experienced as delicious by typical human observers.

* (7) The same meaning as (5) or (6) but _without regard_ for whether anyone will or could experience these facts about the ice cream. 

I chose to examine “Ice cream is delicious” here because it is ambiguous as to whether or not we would ordinarily consider it to be aesthetic judgment or a factual judgment. (∞KANT 52–53) Moreover, many of these different interpretations might be acceptable in certain circumstances. Imagine that I am picking out a desert for my own birthday party. In that case, I want something that suits me, so a meaning like (2) might hold or perhaps (1) if there is a free sample available at the grocery store. On the other hand, suppose I am picking out ice cream for someone else’s birthday party. In that case, I am guessing what sort of desert the celebrant will find pleasure from consuming. Interpretations (4), (5), or even (6) might apply in these cases.

Whether a more aesthetic judgment such as "this artwork is beautiful" is regarded as subjective or objective overall will depend in part on how we define those terms. Let us briefly run down the same seven possible interpretations:

* (1) We might mean by “this artwork is beautiful” that the work I am experiencing now _seems_ beautiful to me at this moment.

* (2) We might mean that I habitually find that I tend to have an experience of beauty when experiencing this work.

* (3) We might mean that though I am not currently attending to beauty of the work, the work exists in my field of experience in such a way that I would experience beauty if I were to attend to it.

* (4) We might mean that any _suitable spectator_ will have an experience of beauty when experiencing this object.

* (5) We might mean that the work under discussion possesses a _capacity_ to induce experiences of beauty in suitable spectators.

* (6) We might mean that the work has a form which would be identified by an ideal evaluator as one that is inherently beautiful (perhaps because of the balance of the elements or some other aspect of its form).

* (7) The same meaning as (5) or (6) but _without regard_ for whether anyone will or could experience these facts. 

It seems initially clear that at least some degree of subjective involvement is prerequisite for our ordinary experience of aesthetic judgments, hence interpretation (7) can be ruled out. Even if we lay aside Kantian worries about whether facts without the possibility of experience are empty, it is clear enough that aesthetic judgment must be connected to at least some possibility of an aesthetic experience if it is to deserve the appellation “aesthetic.” Whatever such experiences would be, to the extent that they lack a basis in at least possible experience, they would not be aesthetic.

On the other hand, if debate about aesthetic judgments is productive (and it appears to be), we must reject interpretations (1), (2), and (3) for being too personal. As previously mentioned, aesthetic discussion requires a common subject of debate. It is possible that these discussions are, contrary to appearances, entirely devoid of meaning, but this hypothesis is in conflict with everyday experience. It is possible for science or philosophy to drive us to affirm hypotheses that are in conflict with everyday experience, but only where a great balance of evidence can be brought to bear. (1), (2), and (3) ought only to be accept in the case that it can be shown impossible or at least highly improbable that to have a true aesthetic dialogue.

Compared to interpretations (1), (2), (3), or (7), interpretation (6) seems much more promising. Indeed, many take it that the resolution of the question “is beauty in the eye of the beholder” turns on just this. If (6) is the correct interpretation, beauty is not just in the eye of the beholder, but if (6) is the wrong interpretation, it is not. They often go on to propose a formal definition of beauty which an ideal evaluator must possess in order to judge rightly. In the concluding chapter of this dissertation, I shall argue that this is interpretation of the meaning of the question of aesthetic subjectivity is incorrect. There is a way for beauty to be outside of the eye of the beholder without requiring the correctness of interpretation (6). For now, suffice it to argue instead that the balance of empirical evidence is against it. Although aesthetic discussion appears to exist and be productive, aesthetic consensus about forms and styles appears to be only temporary and local. For example, Western science has all but eliminated rival methods for the naturalistic description of the world, for better or worse. By comparison, even very popular styles of art, such as the Hollywood blockbuster, have only a narrow appeal. Not even all Americans enjoy Hollywood movies, and we often find that an art style's prestige among connoisseurs is uncorrelated or even inversely correlated with its popularity with the public at large. If interpretation (6) is correct, it is a curious fact in need of explanation that no science of aesthetics has yet emerged.

In that case, interpretations (4) and (5) remain as the most likely interpretations of the meaning of a typical aesthetic judgment. Under either of these interpretations, the next project in aesthetics will be describing what the characteristics are that make a suitable spectator and explaining what it is that makes the suitable spectator so suitable for spectating. In later chapters, I will take up just this challenge. (Although I will note that the word “spectator” is an inapt term to describe the suitable subject of aesthetic judgment.)

Whether a judgment interpreted in the manner of (4) or (5) should be classified as a "subjective" or "objective" judgment will turn on what we take to be its most relevant feature. Clearly, (4) is the more subjective of the pair and (5) is the more objective, but both are only relatively subjective or objective. If we say that what makes the suitable spectator suitable is her conformity to some sort of universal standard, then we will accept interpretation (5) and classify aesthetic judgment as objective, since the object’s ability to be seen as having the relevant aspect is logically prior to the suitability of the subject. On the other hand, if we emphasize that the suitability of the spectator is cultivated for a particular situation, then we will accept interpretation (4) and classify the judgment as subjective, since it is the structure of the subject which allowed the object to be seen in a particular way. In either case, our choice of nomenclature will be heavily dependent on our view of the nature of the human subject and the world around. As such, no firm answer to the question of whether aesthetic judgment is subjective or objective can be given until we have better described the subject, the object, and the division between them (if there is any).

###Historical approaches to explaining the role of the subject and object in aesthetics
If we take our starting point in aesthetics to be either the experience of a suitable spectator or the capacity of an object to induce such an experience, then questions about what makes a spectator suitable and how the spectator relates to the object of experience naturally follow. To begin our investigation, I wish to briefly examine how Plato and Kant would have resolved these questions in order to show that existing approaches to aesthetics have been hampered by an unnecessarily dualism of subject and object at the surface level, which must then be punctured at a transcendental level in order accommodate our intuitive beliefs about aesthetics.

####Plato, beauty, and the form of the good
To speak of Plato's approach to aesthetics is peculiar in the sense that he rejects *aisthesis* <!-- [αἴσθησις][el]--> (value neutral perception) as a means of grasping the form of beauty itself (*kalon*<!-- [καλόν][el]-->, a word that means both "beautiful" and "good"). Plato’s aesthetics are large topic and my criticisms are somewhat tangential to the discussion that follows, so here I will restrict myself to a relatively brief description of his explanation of beauty in *The Republic*.

Although the phrase "beauty is in the eye of the beholder" is a mutilated paraphrase of Plato,† his actual view was nearly the opposite. For Plato, the beauty of a work is measured by how well it participates in the form of beauty, not to the subjective capacity of perceivers to recognize this beauty.

† As translated by Nehamas and Woodruff, the original quote is "when he looks at Beauty in the only way that Beauty can be seen [viz. with the intellect]---only then will it become possible for him to give birth not to images of virtue (because he's in touch with no images), but to true virtue (because he's in touch with the true Beauty)" (*Symposium*, 212a). The point of the dialogue is that only when the externally real form of beauty enters into the beholder will that beholder be transformed into a truly virtuous person.

In *The Republic*, the character Socrates use the sun as an analogy for the form of the good. Just as the sun is the brightest and most beautiful object in the sky, the form of the good is, he claims, the most compelling and beautiful form in the intelligible realm. An understanding of this is a prerequisite to making any reliable judgments, aesthetic or otherwise. Socrates explains

> in the knowable realm, the last thing to be seen is the form of the good, and it is seen only with toil and trouble. Once one has seen it, however, one must infer that it is the cause of all that is correct and beautiful in anything, that in the visible realm it produces both light and its source, and that in the intelligible realm it controls and provides truth and understanding; and that anyone who is to act sensibly in private or public must see it. (517b--c)

Because of this priority of the forms over things, the beauty of a thing is always, in a sense, predetermined. Nevertheless, there is some slight space left in Plato's thinking for a human role in the creation of beauty. The analogy being made here between the sun and the good is a little obscure from the perspective of modern thought. In modern physics and biology, we think of a beam of light as coming from the sun, being partially reflected by an object, and finally the remaining reflection is absorbed by the eye, which senses the light. Plato thought that light comes from the sun and is absorbed by the object, giving the object its color. Separately, the eye gives off a ray of vision which then perceives the color that now inheres in the thing. In the same way, Plato is claiming that the form of the good gives off "rays" of truth that lend to forms their essence, just as light imparts color in a thing. The beauty of a thing, therefore, is merely derivative of its relationship to the form of the good, from which all goodness, truth, and beauty originate. Nevertheless, a ray of understanding must be produces from the mind of the human beholder if this form is to be grasped. It does not just passively reflect off of the form in order to enter the knower. This gives the knower some participation in the thing known, although it is only slight.

Throughout this discussion, Socrates emphasizes strongly that the beauty of the form of the good is independent of the beauty of particular goods or beautiful things. As he says,

> what gives truth to the things known and the power to know to the knower is the form of the good. And as the cause of knowledge and truth, you must think of it as an object of knowledge. Both knowledge and truth are beautiful things. But if you are to think correctly, you must think of the good as other and more beautiful than they. (508e)

In Plato's system, the power of the form of the good overflows itself and spills out onto the intellectual realm giving the forms their beauty. The good is, we may say, the form of the forms. Being good is what all the forms have in common, hence goodness is the form above all forms. Furthermore, all being shares at least partially in the good (to be is to be causally efficacious, and to be causally efficacious is to be able to do what it is your essential nature to do), hence goodness itself is beyond all questions of existence or non-existence. The good imparts being into things, rather than taking its being from the particulars that instantiate it as a universal:

> The sun, I think you would say, not only gives visible things the power to be seen but also provides for their coming-to-be, growth, and nourishment---although it is not itself coming to be. […] Therefore, you should say that not only do the objects of knowledge owe their being known to the good, but their existence and being are also due to it; although the good is not being, but something yet beyond being, superior to it in rank and power. (509b)

As a corollary to this, in a certain sense everything in the world participates (if only partially) in the form of beauty because everything that exists does so in virtue of participation in the all beautiful form of the good. Disagreements about aesthetic judgments must therefore be rooted in disagreement about the degree to which a thing participates in beauty, and not whether it does at all. Everything is beautiful to the extent that it is what it is.

From this we may conclude that for Plato, beautiful works are themselves only means by which we recollect the beauty of the forms, which towers over all particulars in its abstract iridescence. The beauty of a thing is only important for Plato as a ladder by which we may ascend to a higher understanding of the form of beauty in itself. While it is true that in some cases not all subjects will be suitable to grasp the beauty of a particular thing, it is nevertheless the thing's relationship to the form of beauty which ought to be determinative of our aesthetic judgments. The role of the aesthetic subject is just to produce the "ray" of understanding needed to draw the truth in.

Nevertheless, although the beauty of a thing is an objective fact about the thing regarding its relationship to the form of the good, not all subjects are suitable to perceive or render judgments about it. Plato has much to say in *The Republic* about how a subject may become more suitable to grasp the forms, and a large part of the work is dedicated to a fairly practical discussion of pedagogy. Nevertheless, the relationship of the form and the thing is logically prior to the suitability or unsuitability of particular aesthetic subjects. As a result, education means the turning of the subject towards the aesthetic truth, rather than any contribution of the subject to that truth:

> just as an eye cannot be turned around from darkness to light except by turning the whole body, so this instrument must be turned around from what-comes-to-be together with the whole soul, until it is able to bear to look at what is and at the brightest thing that is---the one we call the good. (518c)

Thus according to Plato, until we transform ourselves by moving up the ladder of understanding from particulars to universals and then coming back to the particulars with a full grasp of the form of the good, our aesthetic experiences will always be incomplete and our aesthetic judgments only tentative and hypothetical.

Plato's claim that only those who know the form of the good are qualified to speak of it culminates in Book X with the banishment of poets (that is, people who do *poieō*<!-- [ποιέω][el]-->, makers or imitators) from the city that Socrates is proposing. The reason for their banishment is that they imitate particular things instead of directly imitating the universal forms. This puts them a third hand remove from the truth, since the things were made by craftspeople who only copy what they are told about the form by those who use their products. Here we see that Plato identifies art with representationalism, and at the same time, Plato condemns art because it is merely representing the actual world, instead of the ideal world.

Throughout his writings, Plato makes that the claim that really useful knowledge can only be possessed when we know the form, and this leads Socrates to ask,

> if Homer had really been able to educate people and make them better, if he had been able, not to imitate such matters but to know about them, wouldn't he have had many companions who honored and loved him? (600c)

Socrates' comment is odd, and the irony that someone who was condemned to death by his fellow Athenians should make such a remark can scarcely have escaped Plato's notice. Clearly, *The Republic* itself qualifies as a work of "poetry" given the level of craftsmanship that went into its production. In this sense, Plato is perhaps suggesting that there is a future for the arts after all. Once they step away from representationalism, will the artists be permitted to return to the city after all? *The Republic* itself does not say, but Plato may have intended this riddle to have a solution. What is clear in any event is that this solution will not overturn the basic pattern of aesthetics established above. True beauty comes from accord with the form of the good, and human subjects must align themselves with that goodness if they are to be just and virtuous. In that sense, the subject is superfluous to aesthetics, as true beauty is ideal, eternal, and otherworldly.

One final remark to be made about the aesthetics of *The Republic* is that because beauty can only be understood in terms of its source---the form of the good---there can ultimately be no separation between public political unity and private aesthetic bliss. Throughout *The Republic* Socrates and his interlocutors condemn any cultural artifact that they believe undermines the unity of the city. The philosopher who has a private experience of leaving the cave and seeing the sun is required to return to the cave and instruct his fellow prisoners about what it is like and change their artistic practices to match the pre-existing divine pattern. In that sense, the private aesthetic feelings of the individual have no real meaning apart from their proper positioning within the public totality, and the public totality can do little more than mirror its eternal counterpart in the realm of the forms.

####Exposition and critique of Kant’s universal subjective
> … when [a man] puts a thing on a pedestal and calls it beautiful, he demands the same delight from others. He judges not merely for himself, but for all men, and then speaks of beauty as if it were a property of things. Thus he says that the thing is beautiful; and it is not as if he counts on others agreeing with him in his judgment of liking owing to his having found them in such agreement on a number of occasions, but he demands this agreement of them. He blames them if they judge differently, and denies them taste, which he still requires of them as something they ought to have; and to this extent it is not open to men to say: Every one has his own taste. This would be equivalent to saying that there is no such thing as taste, i.e. no aesthetic judgment capable of making a rightful claim upon the assent of all men. (Kant 1790, p. 52; see also pp. 136–139.)

- How is subjective universal different from just objective???

Having coined our modern usage of the terms “objective” and “subjective,” Kant was aware of the difficulties of classifying aesthetic judgments. He attempted to resolve these difficulties in his _Critique of Judgment_ by arguing that judgments of the beautiful and sublime have a universal but merely subjective validity. Kant claims that such judgments are ultimately subjective because they are based on indeterminate concepts and not truth-apt. Since they lack determined boundaries, the presentation of these concepts will inevitably vary from subject to subject, individual to individual. Nothing can be said about the truth of such judgments in general, since absent any objectivity, there is no truth to be had. On the other hand, they are universals, since we are able to appreciate them together as rational beings via our _sensus communis_ and over the course of historical time we do seem to see some convergences in aesthetic judgments, such that discussion of them is not entirely unfruitful.

The key insight of Kant’s “Copernican Revolution” in thinking about the relationship between our experiences and the world is that he creates a three tired system with subjective, objective, and noumenal levels. On the subjective level are those judgments which are particular to the individual and incommunicable. On the noumenal level are the things in themselves as they are apart from all possible experience of them. What allows for communication is the objective level at which individual reasoners apply Universal Reason in order to grasp the ideal construction of the object. For example, suppose I see a chair. My subjective experience of the chair is private, and the thing in itself that has caused me to have that experience is unknowable, but I am able to communicate to you about the chair because I know that since we are both rational beings, we share the same universal Reason, which will construct the same objects of possible experience for either of us. The better I can describe the possible experiences that any rational being could have with the chair, the better I have described it as an object. In other words, conformity to pure reason is what defines the suitability of a subject to make a particular judgment.

###Aesthetics beyond the atomic subject
Existing approaches to aesthetics are unsatisfying because they start with an atomic self and then go on to replace that with an idealized communal self (the suitable spectator). 

Plato’s theory works backwards from universal forms to the isolated souls that recollect them. 

The difficulty with Kant’s approach is that it begins with the assumption of a basic separation of persons into atomic individuals and only then tries to find a way to unite the disparate experience of those different individuals into the experience of a single, unified world. For Kant, the key force that unifies the experience of disparate individuals is Reason in its theoretical, practical, and aesthetic forms. 

In both cases, the picture of aesthetic judgment as subjective or objective is intimately tied to an overall view of the subject and object as dichotomously separated. However, if we overturn the assumption of the inviolate atomicity of the human being then we will be presented with a radically new way to understand the nature of aesthetic experience, which in turn will better clarify the position of aesthetic judgment.


###Watsuji Tetsurō and the subject of aesthetics

We find one such anthropology of the human being as fundamentally relational in the work of [Watsuji][sc] Tetsurō, and through it I will answer the following questions in aesthetics:

* • What is distinctive about aesthetic experience as opposed to ordinary experience? (Chapter 3)
* &nbsp;
* • Is aesthetic judgment subjective or objective? How is aesthetic agreement possible? Is there such a thing as compulsion in aesthetic judgment? Is aesthetic experience active (agentive) or passive (observed)? (Chapter 4)
* &nbsp;
* • Why are there regional variations in aesthetics? Is there such a thing as progress in aesthetics? Why are there persistent aesthetic disagreements? (Chapter 5)
* &nbsp;
* • What is genius? Is aesthetic goodness independent or is it subordinate to other societal concerns? (Chapter 6)

But before we answer these questions, we must first address questions about the nature of the human being and its method of study (Chapter 2).
