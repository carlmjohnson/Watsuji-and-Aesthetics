##Chapter 1. The Problem of Aesthetic Judgment
###Problem of subjectivity and objectivity in aesthetic judgment
One central problem in aesthetics is determining whether aesthetic judgment is formed on a subjective or objective basis. Suppose that aesthetic judgment is completely subjective, such that statements of the form “That is beautiful” may be interpreted without loss as meaning “I find that to be beautiful.” In that case, no discussion about whether or not something is beautiful ought to arise, since my saying “That is beautiful” and your saying “That is not beautiful” are no more contradictory than my saying “I like licorice” and your saying “I do not like licorice.” To have a basis for disagreement, individual feeling is insufficient. There needs to be some common object of our disagreement. I believe that object is one way and you believe it is another way. Through dialogue, we are able to resolve our disagreements and come to a mutual understanding of the object. 

However, to posit that aesthetic judgment is completely objective also seems to be problematic. First, despite no shortage of attempts, no one has been able to definitively specify the formal criteria of many of aesthetic predicates. While there have been many attempts to do so, none has gained consensus. This might not be so strange in itself, but at the same time, individuals have no hesitance about expressing their personal feeling about whether a work does or does not exhibit particular aesthetic predicates in some aesthetic judgment. We might attribute this social phenomenon to widespread ignorance or willingness to give an opinion without first obtaining a solid basis for rendering judgments, but we also have the experience of saying things like, “I understand why you think X is beautiful, but it just doesn’t ‘work’ for me.” In other words, we appeal to our feelings as individuals when discussing aesthetics though we just saw that individual feeling is an insufficient basis for discussion. 

If we approach taste as a wholly subjective or individualistic matter, at least two problems result. First, without any common object shared by different participants in a discussion, it is not possible for any mutual discussion of aesthetics to take place. This is contradicted by our experience, in which aesthetics is fruitfully discussed, at least sometimes. Second, in the limit, there will be no ability for one to cultivate one’s aesthetic judgment, since there will be nothing outside of a momentary, subjective experience to appeal to in the cultivation of one’s taste.

If, on the other hand, we take taste to be a matter of wholly objective or collectivistic aesthetic canons, we also encounter at least two problems. First, that no canon has been universally accepted (though there are of course many historically and regionally specific canons of taste). This may be a merely epistemological difficulty on our part or some other sort of ordinary failing in our pursuit of aesthetic objectivity, but such a difficulty points to a second problem, which is that a wholly objective canon will be formally disconnected from the experience of personal assent or appreciation. It seems impossible that something could be objectively beautiful yet disagreeable to all possible perceivers of the object. However without some link from objective beauty to the subject’s judgment of agreeability, such a possibility cannot be ruled out. 

To shed light on this discussion of aesthetic judgment, let us take simple judgments like, “This apple is red” or “The table is square.” Are these judgments objective or subjective? There are at least six ways to interpret the question:

1\. We might mean by “this apple is red” or “this table is square” that it _seems_ that way to me right now. I am having a reddish experience of the apple or a squarish experience of the table.

2\. Suppose that one is looking a quadrangular table from such an angle that it _appears_ as a square to one’s vision center. Under ordinary conditions, one would nevertheless perceive it aspectivally as quadrangular, since the human vision centers naturally correct for angles of perspective and cause us to experience a square table _as_ square even if seen from an angle that makes it seem non-square, and vice versa to see a non-square table as non-square even if it happens to form a square shape from one’s perspective. Similarly, a green apple might appear as reddish under a reddish light, but one’s vision will naturally correct for the apparent color of the apple so that it continues to be seen as green while appearing red.[^] (Normally, only artists are trained to notice the difference between how things seem aspectivally and how they appear non-aspectivally, but it can be noticed without any particular training.)

[^]: See, for example, Adelson’s checkerboard illusion in which two squares of the checker look like different colors though they are actually the same shade of gray: <`http://web.mit.edu/persci/people/adelson/checkershadow_illusion.html`>.

3\. We might mean that the apple or table will seem red or square to any _suitable spectator_--that is, any time a “normal” human being with ordinary vision, stands a normal distance away under normal lighting conditions, etc., etc. that person will see these things as seeming red or square.

4\. We might mean by red having a measurable _capacity_ to reflect light of approximately 630 to 740 nanometers in wavelength when exposed to light of the ordinary spectrum at ordinary intensities at ordinary temperatures, etc. (An apple may still be red in a dark room.) We might mean by square having the tendency to be found square when measured by a normal observer under normal conditions.

5\. We might mean by red _currently_ emitting light of approximately 630 to 740 nanometers in wavelength or by square currently having an angle of ninety degrees at each of its four corners and sides of equal length, as measurable by some idealized observer.

6\. The same meaning as four or five but _without regard_ for whether anyone will or could experience these facts. 

These six interpretations have generally been arranged from those having more subjective involvement to those that are more objective, yet each is an equally acceptable as an interpretation of the natural language judgments in question. When considering whether aesthetic judgments are “subjective” or “objective,” it will be correspondingly difficult to answer in a univocal fashion. Whether aesthetic judgment is regarded as subjective or objective overall will depend in part on how we define those terms. However it seems clear that at least some degree of subjective involvement is prerequisite for our ordinary experience of aesthetic judgments, hence interpretation six can be ruled out. Aesthetic judgment must be connected to at least some possibility of experience. The lack of consensus about the formal definitions of many aesthetic predicates also makes it unlikely that something like interpretations four or five might be widely adopted. (The claim that beauty is a certain arrangement of forms, for example.) On the other hand, if debate about aesthetic judgments is productive (and it appears to be), we must reject interpretations one for being too personal to be the basis for productive discussion of aesthetics. Interpretation two on the other hand can be rejected for emphasizing a part of our perception that goes unnoticed under ordinary conditions. In that case, only interpretation three remains as a viable analogy for aesthetic judgment. Under this interpretation, the aesthetic judgment “This rose is beautiful” will mean something like the rose would seem beautiful to a suitable spectator.[^] Whether such a judgment should be classified as subjective or objective will turn on what we take to be its most relevant feature. If we say that what makes the suitable spectator suitable is her conformity to some sort of universal standard, then we will classify the judgment as objective, since the object’s ability to be seen as having the relevant aspect is logically prior to the suitability of the subject. On the other hand, if we emphasize that the suitability of the spectator is cultivated for a particular situation, then we will classify the judgment as subjective, since it is the structure of the subject which allowed the object to be seen in a particular way. In either case, our choice of nomenclature will be heavily dependent on our view of the nature of the human subject and the world around. As such, no firm answer to the question of whether aesthetic judgment is subjective or objective can be given until we have better described the subject, the object, and the division between them (if there is any).

###Plato and the representationalist tradition
Seen historically, Plato’s theory of beauty can be taken as an exemplary of the objectivist approach to aesthetic judgment. For Plato, the beauty of an object is related to how well it participates in the form of beauty, not to the subjective capacity of perceivers to recognize this beauty. In a certain sense, Plato’s theory of beauty is an anti-“aesthetic” theory, since he rejects *aisthesis* (neutral perception) as a means of grasping Beauty itself. Beautiful objects are themselves only means by which we recollect the form of Beauty, which towers over all particulars in its abstract iridescence. While it is true that in some cases not all subjects will be suitable to grasp the beauty of a particular object, it is nevertheless the object’s relationship to Beauty which is determinative of its beauty. Though Plato has much to say about how a subject may become more suitable to grasp the forms, it is that relationship of the form and the object which is logically prior to the suitability or unsuitability of particular subjects.

###Exposition and critique of Kant’s universal subjective
Having coined our modern usage of the terms “objective” and “subjective,” Kant was aware of the difficulties of classifying aesthetic judgments. He attempted to resolve these difficulties in his _Critique of Judgment_ by arguing that judgments of the beautiful and sublime have a universal but merely subjective validity. Kant claims that such judgments are ultimately subjective because they are based on indeterminate concepts and not truth-apt. Since they lack determined boundaries, the presentation of these concepts will inevitably vary from subject to subject, individual to individual. Nothing can be said about the truth of such judgments in general, since absent any objectivity, there is no truth to be had. On the other hand, they are universals, since we are able to appreciate them together as rational beings via our _sensus communis_ and over the course of historical time we do seem to see some convergences in aesthetic judgments, such that discussion of them is not entirely unfruitful.

The key insight of Kant’s “Copernican Revolution” in thinking about the relationship between our experiences and the world is that he creates a three tired system with subjective, objective, and noumenal levels. On the subjective level are those judgments which are particular to the individual and incommunicable. On the noumenal level are the things in themselves as they are apart from all possible experience of them. What allows for communication is the objective level at which individual reasoners apply Universal Reason in order to grasp the ideal construction of the object. For example, suppose I see a chair. My subjective experience of the chair is private, and the thing in itself that has caused me to have that experience is unknowable, but I am able to communicate to you about the chair because I know that since we are both rational beings, we share the same universal Reason, which will construct the same objects of possible experience for either of us. The better I can describe the possible experiences that any rational being could have with the chair, the better I have described it as an object. In other words, conformity to pure reason is what defines the suitability of a subject to make a particular judgment.

###Beyond the atomic subject
The difficulty with Kant’s approach is that it begins with the assumption of a basic separation of persons into atomic individuals and only then tries to find a way to unite the disparate experience of those different individuals into the experience of a single, unified world. For Kant, the key force that unifies the experience of disparate individuals is Reason in its theoretical, practical, and aesthetic forms. Similarly, Plato’s theory works backwards from universal forms to the isolated souls that recollect them. In both cases, the picture of aesthetic judgment as subjective or objective is intimately tied to an overall view of the subject and object as dichotomously separated. However, if we overturn the assumption of the inviolate atomicity of the human being then we will be presented with a radically new way to understand the nature of aesthetic experience, which in turn will better clarify the position of aesthetic judgment. We find one such anthropology of the human being as fundamentally relational in the work of [Watsuji][sc] Tetsurō, and through it I will answer the following questions in aesthetics:

* • What is distinctive about aesthetic experience as opposed to ordinary experience? Is aesthetic judgment subjective or objective? Is there a difference between performance art and the plastic arts? (Chapter 3)
* &nbsp;
* • How is aesthetic agreement possible? Is there such a thing as compulsion in aesthetic judgment? Is aesthetic experience active (agentive) or passive (observed)? (Chapter 4)
* &nbsp;
* • Why are there regional variations in aesthetics? Is there such a thing as progress in aesthetics? What is genius? Is aesthetics independent or is it subordinate to other concerns? Why are there persistent aesthetic disagreements? (Chapter 5)
* &nbsp;
* • Is there any link between beauty and (moral) goodness? How does aesthetics relate to religion? (Chapter 6)

But before we answer these questions, we must first address questions about the nature of the human being and its method of study (Chapter 2).
