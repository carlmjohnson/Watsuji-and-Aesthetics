##Chapter 3. Aesthetic Experience as Distancing, Dissolution, and Disinterest

<toc />

###Defining aesthetics
Before we can describe the nature of aesthetic experience, we must explore the meaning of the word “aesthetics” itself. Although ancient Greek word [αἰσθητά][gr] is the source of the contemporary word “aesthetics,” the meanings of the two are quite different. [Αἰσθητά][gr], the sensible, came from the root [αἰσθάνομαι][gr] (“I perceive”) and was opposed to [νοητά][gr], the intelligible, but not directly connected to the perception of beauty or other “aesthetic” feelings.[^] “Aesthetics” was only given its current meaning in eighteenth century by Baumgarten in his *Aesthetica*, which attempted to create a science connecting our senses to our perception of beauty. Nevertheless, Kant attempted to restore the ancient Greek meaning in the Transcendental Aesthetic part of his _Critique of Pure Reason_ on the grounds that such a science could not be made wholly *a priori*.[^]

[^]: Indeed, for Plato, Beauty, which is identified as the lure of the Good, resides firmly in the camp of the intelligible and out of the camp of the sensible.
[^]: See Kant’s note at A 21.

The distinction between aesthetics as the value feeling of beauty and aesthetics as the science of perception is registered linguistically in Japanese. One translation of aesthetics, _bigaku_ [美学][ja], is a Sino-Japanese compound meaning literally “the study of the beautiful.”[^] This translation relates exclusively to the contemporary meaning of aesthetics. Another translation of aesthetics into Japanese is as _kansei_ [感性][ja], which might also be rendered into English as “sensibility.” This second translation is closer to the usage of Kant and the ancient Greeks. Unlike the neutral “sense” or “perception,” however, the _kan_ part of _kansei_ strongly implies the feeling of emotion or value, not merely valueless sense data.[^] For the purposes of this study, the question is how it is possible for something like _kansei_, our individual value feelings, to be the basis of _bigaku_, what is felt to be beautiful as such. If we identify _kansei_ with individual experience and _bigaku_ with collective experience, we see that Watsuji’s anthropology of _ningen_, which connects the individual and the collective via a double negation, may play a vital role in explaining their connection.

[^]: For an account of the emergence of _bigaku_ as the standard translation of “aesthetics,” see the introduction to Marra, Michael (ed.). _A History of Modern Japanese Aesthetics_ (U. Hawaii Press, 2001), pp. 1--22.
[^]: Shogakukan’s Japanese dictionary gives “one’s heart-mind moving from contact with something external; the moving of the heart-mind” as its primary definition for _kan_ [感][ja].

Traditional definitions are given by a genus and a specific difference. Clearly, the genus for aesthetic experience is experience. But what is the specific difference between aesthetic experience and other experiences? What are the conditions for having an aesthetic experience and what is the outcome of aesthetic experience? In what follows, I will attempt to show that the condition for aesthetic experience is a sense of *psychic distance* from the object of experience, and the outcome is feeling of ecstatic unity with the object of experience or *intoxicated dissolution*. The process as a whole may be said to be a process of enjoying a *disinterested pleasure* from the object’s existence.

###Perception in everyday experience
In his _Study of Ethics_, Watsuji claims, “when a flower is said to be beautiful, the flower’s ‘being beautiful’ is based on a specific way of existing for the human beings who found the flower” (WTZ 10:141). What is this way of existing? To perceive something as beautiful, it is necessary that we first take a certain stance or attitude towards that object. 

In ordinary experience, we do not distinctly perceive the objects around us, but we unselfconsciously treat them as tools for manipulating our environment. As Heidegger explains in his famous example of the hammer from _Being and Time_, we treat objects that are ready-to-hand around us as having an in-order-to structure, and it is only when something occurs to make them unusable that they become conspicuous and obtrusive as present-at-hand.[^] When one hammers at a nail expertly, one does not think of the hammer or the nail. Rather, they melt into the background of experience. But when something happens to break the union of self and tool, say the head of the hammer becomes lose or the hammer is not there when one reaches for it, suddenly these background elements in experience are sharply foregrounded because they have frustrated one’s desires.

[^]: See Division One, Part III, A. of Martin Heidegger, _Being and Time_.

Perception in general can be said to be “aspectival” in that we do not merely see what things are around us, but we see them according to its aspect _as_ something or another. In Wittgenstein’s famous duck-rabbit example, we find that we see the ambiguous image _as_ a duck or _as_ a rabbit, or as one and then as the other in rapid succession. It is only with the patience of an artist that we can allow our eye to see the duck-rabbit as just lines on paper or as just visual stimuli.
 
As a result of this aspectival perception, under ordinary circumstances, we only weakly distinguish between ourselves and our environment. The boundary of the self and the world is marked by the gradual diminishment of our ability to interactively control what happens around us. As described in the last chapter, our sense of self is a constant movement of negation by which the self establishes its boundaries by creating a system of oppositions to the self and then reconciling those oppositions. This happens on a social scale, but also on the more intimate scale of the body. Merleau-Ponty gives the example of a blind man using a stick to “see” the space around him:

> The blind man’s stick has ceased to be an object for him, and is no longer perceived for itself; its point has become an area of sensitivity, extending the scope and active radius of touch, and providing a parallel to sight. In the exploration of things, the length of the stick does not enter expressly as a middle term: the blind man is rather aware of it through the position of objects than of the position of objects through it.‎[^]

[^]: Merleau-Ponty, Maurice. _Phenomenology of Perception_, tr. Donald Landes (Psychology Press: 2002), p. 165.

The same can be said of driving a car or riding a bicycle. When an experienced driver goes over a pothole, the driver does not have the sensation that his or her physical body is moving in such-and-such a manner but _feels_ the tire dip into the pothole in such a way that it is as if the feeling were happening in the tire, as though the tire itself were a part of driver’s body or connected to the driver’s nervous system.

Another side of aspectival perception is the fact that we identify different perceptions as corresponding to the same object over time and even across sense modalities. For example, one might see a table at time A and again at time B and without thinking identify it as the same object (perhaps incorrectly, but that is not relevant at this stage of our analysis). One might see a guitar and hear music and identify the source of the sight and the source of the sound as one identical object. One might even see a pie at time A and taste a flavor at time B and identify the same object as being behind these different modes of sense at different times. Even something as basic to our perceptual experience as three-dimensional vision requires the correlation of sense data. The right and left eyes see slightly different scenes, but in experience we are presented with a single, three dimensional space instead of two separate two-dimensional images.

What are the implications of our weaving different sensations and senses into a unified experience? In “I Touch What I Saw,” Arindam Chakrabarti argues that “Realisms about the self and about the external world entail each other.”[^] He writes,

[^]: Chakrabarti, Arindam. “I Touch What I Saw” in _Philosophy and Phenomenological Research_ Vol. 52:1 (March 1992), p. 103.

> Our actual---if you like, *naive*---conception of a bit of experience with a structured content involves at least two types of items *outside* the experience, at its two opposite extremities, as it were. On the one hand, it requires a single experiencer capable of retaining its felt identity over a series of successive experiences. On the other hand, it depends upon an object with some features or a constellation of objects and features in terms of which its content is to be cashed. This dual individuation-dependence makes recognitive perceptual judgements at once evidences of the same I who touches and sees as well as of the same object which is touched and seen. It also conceptually requires that we distinguish the I from the touching and seeing as well as the object from the texture and color.[^]

[^]: _Ibid_, 113--4.

In other words, the synesthetic re-identification of objects of experience over time and across sensory modalities which is the basis of external realism requires an internal realism as well. External realism is true if and only if internal realism is true.  How might a Buddhist-influenced philosopher like Watsuji deal with this contention? I believe he would accept the biconditional offered by Chakrabarti: subjects and objects are equally real---and equally unreal. As was explained in the last chapter, the individual subject is not strictly substantive for Watsuji. At the same time, however, it would be wrong to call Watsuji a nihilist about individuals. An individual is one moment in the on-going movement of human existence between the social pole and the individual pole of relational space. By the same token, if individual subjects subsist as a moment in the process of double negation, objects of perception must also be created through a process of negation. They are marked apart from the self as things which are not the self, but they are also things perceived and as perceived they are _the self’s_ perceptions.

To conclude, in ordinary perception, our interest in things around us which we cannot control renders them as objects outside of us. We perceive them _as_, according to some concept or another, and we identify them across time and sense modalities. In doing so, we must correspondingly construct a sense of ourselves as opposed to these objects.[^]  Things which we can control, however, are incorporated into the self and felt as a part of the self until they disappear into the background of perception.

[^]: As Fichte claimed, an object ([_Gegenstand_][de]) implies opposition ([_Widerstand_][de]). In English, we might say an object is that which objects.

###Disinterestedness and the aesthetic attitude 
Given the foregoing discussion of perception, for aesthetic experience to take place it is necessary that a sense of otherness between the self and the object of aesthetic experience first be created. So long as the would-be experience does not create some initial boundary between a subject and its object, aesthetic experience is not possible. This otherness is felt due to the non-instrumentality of the object. The object is not what the subject wants nor is it an extension of the subject by which it can get what it wants. Normally, an object that is neither the locus of the self nor an object of desire would fade into the background of experience. It is impossible for everything around us to be given full and equal attention, so attention focuses on what in the field of experience seems to have the most salience. Aesthetic experience, however, breaks this ordinary pattern.

In aesthetic experience, the cleavage of the object from the subject is an occasion for a movement of the subject away from itself and towards the object. In this phase of aesthetic experience, there is a certain kind of withdrawal from the self which allows us to see things apart from our interest in them. The self is aware of itself as over here and the object as over there, but it is also aware of the perspective that the object has as it is over there. We distance ourselves from our ordinary concerns for and about the object and having done so relate to the object on its terms rather than our own. We step outside of ourselves, hence the feeling of “ek-stasis.” This gives us a sense of pleasure as we begin to experience the wholeness of the object from its perspective rather than our own.

This concept was also explicated by [Nishida][sc] Kitarō ([西田幾多郎][ja], 1870--1945), who had a profound effect on Watsuji’s philosophy. In “An Explanation of Beauty,”[^] Nishida connects the feeling of beauty to the Buddhist concept of *muga* [無我][ja]. *Muga* is written with characters that literally mean “without” and “I,” and it was used as a translation of the Sanskrit term *[anātman][sa]* or “no self.” According to Nishida, beauty is the particular form of pleasure we feel when we achieve a state of selfless ecstasy:

[^]: *Bi no Setsumei*, [美の説明][ja]. Trans. Steve Odin. _Monumenta Nipponica_, Vol. 42, No. 2 (Summer, 1987), pp. 211-217.

> If I may summarize what has been said above, the feeling of beauty is the feeling of *muga*. Beauty that evokes this feeling of *muga* is intuitive truth that transcends intellectual discrimination. This is why beauty is sublime. As regards this point, beauty can be explained as the discarding of the world of discrimination and the being one with the Great Way of *muga*; it therefore is really of the same kind as religion. (217)

When we reach a state of selflessness it is only natural for this state to result in the spread of a feeling of ecstasy towards all the world:

> Even if a man is an artist of outstanding genius, no one who is mean of heart has ever become a great master. In contrast, however, when we are not in the least restricted by thought of self, not only does pleasure give rise to a sense of beauty, but everything that was originally unpleasant under goes a complete change and provides aesthetic pleasure. (216)

_Muga_ is a state in which we divest ourselves of self-interest without thereby surrendering all interest whatsoever. Rather, we ecstatically take up the interests of the things around us.

While Watsuji was a major cultural historian and critic in his lifetime, he never created a unified system of aesthetics as I am attempting to do here. Nevertheless, he did create some unfinished notes on art theory which were collected and published posthumously.[^] While these cannot be taken as a definitive statement of his aesthetic theory because they were not finished, he does explain that 

[^]: Published in 1992 as a part of _Supplemental Volume 1 to Watsuji’s Complete Works_ (_Watsuji Tetsurō Zenshū Bekkan 1_ [和辻哲郎全集〈別巻 1〉][ja]), hereafter WTZ B1. Apparently, the notes were written in the 1920s, perhaps to help Watsuji give lectures on aesthetics at the universities where he was teaching at the time. The notes are full of untranslated German terms, which indicates they were probably meant more as a mnemonic than a public statement.

> the aesthetic attitude is “an attitude.” And so it is a peculiar *[Genießen][de]* (German, “pleasure”) in which the body is purely entrusted to its impressions. What it identifies as the characteristic of the aesthetic may be said to be a certain spiritual attitude that only appreciates the *expressive value* of the impressions it receives. Although this is, of course, the state of a subject (*shukan* [主観][ja]), nevertheless *it is led by the aesthetic object* and will not follow any “motive” (English in original) which does not exist within it. In that sense, it follows the inherent expressive value of the object and for the sake of the object itself takes up an aesthetic attitude. (WTZ B1:143--4)

When we follow aesthetic experience, we give ourselves over to our object, disregarding ourselves as subjects in relation to it. Having previously given up our interests in the division of the subject and object, we are now free to pursue the “motives” within the object as a substitute for our interests. In doing so, we have an attitude of “disinterest” towards the object. When we are disinterested (not to be confused with “uninterested”), we turn ourselves over to the object without regard for our own purposes for the object.

> In this sense, the aesthetic appreciator can be said to be an appreciator who “contemplates the fullness (German, *[Fülle][de]*) of the object without interest (German, *[uninteressiert][de]*)” as Moritz Geiger says. (WTZ B1:145)


This concept of “disinterest” can be traced back at least as far as Kant, who writes in the _Critique of Judgment_ that the beautiful is the “object of a liking devoid of all interest,”[^] but we only have an adequate understanding of “disinterested liking” when we see that it is the fruit of a process of distancing and dissolution. It is not a mere aloofness from the objects of experience. <!--Heidegger vs. Nietzsche would go here§-->

[^]: Ak. 211.

An example that clearly illustrates the phenomenon of disinterested pleasure is the nude. For a heterosexual male, a beautiful nude woman is an object of lust. In pornography, such objects are offered to the viewer in order to inflame sexual desire. Such images have a very clear in-order-to structure. However, an artistic nude has no such obvious in-order-to structure. If we wish to assign such a structure to the nude, we must do so at something of a remove from the phenomenological experience of the object itself by talking about, for example, the cultural capital that accumulates from appearing sophisticated by appreciating the “high” arts. Such explanations of the purpose of art objects can be valuable and will be pursued in greater depth in later chapters, but for now, let us focus on the experience of seeing the nude itself rather than the phenomena that cause us to see the nude. In a short essay called “On Nude Pictures” (_Rataiga ni Tsuite_ [裸体画について][ja]), Watsuji writes,

> As it is, a living human body is not beautiful in the same sense as a work of art. There is a difficult to cross boundary between an actual physical body that can be the object of sexual desire and a work of art that reveals the beauty of life purely. If one should however have a heart that can retain its moral interest before a nude body, it is possible to discover a beauty that is eternally fresh and mysterious. (WTZ 17:375)

What Watsuji is claiming is that it is only when we can take delight in the nude body as a body rather than as a potential object of conquest that we can begin to experience its aesthetic depths. In my formulation, we must first be aware of the nude as something separate from us, then give ourselves over to its purposes, rather than invest it with our own.

Another good illustration of this point comes from a poem by Goethe:

> The stars not coveted by us<br />
> Delight us with their splendor.[^]

[^]: Cited in Odin, Steve. _Artistic Detachment in Japan and the West: Psychic Distance in Comparative Aesthetics_ (U. Hawaii Press: 2001), p. 30.<!--better cite?§-->

What makes the stars aesthetic objects *par excellence* is their very remoteness from us. Since ordinarily we cannot possibly hope to make use of the stars,[^] we most often just ignore them entirely. It is only from time to time that we become aware of them as aesthetic objects, and in doing so, we take delight in the splendor of the stars as the things that they are, outside of us and outside of our concerns.

[^]: Notice that when navigators do make use of the stars, they cease to be objects of aesthetic experience and become mere tools of navigation.

To be sure, not all purposeless experiences can be counted as being aesthetic experiences. Idly stroking one’s cat as one’s mind wanders has no particular in-order-to structure (cats are too willful and fickle to be counted on as “a thing for petting”), but at the same time, it does not typically achieve the status of aesthetic experience. One pets the cat absentmindedly without making the cat the object of one’s attention; rather, one’s thoughts flit about. To the extent that one does pay attention, it is to the sensation of petting or the feel of the cat’s purring, rather than the cat itself. In this case, disinterest has been achieved without first achieving a proper separation of subject and object in the field of experience.

###Aesthetic experience as double negation
Using the language of the last chapter, we may take the “double negation” that Watsuji used to describe the ethical realm and extend that description beyond ethics to the preceding description of aesthetic experience. In the first negation, we create a psychic distance between the self and object and achieve a state of “psychic distance” between the concern’s of the self and the object as something present-at-hand. If the process stopped there, this would leave us cold and aloof from the world and would not constitute an aesthetic experience. However, this individuating negation is just a necessary precondition of the second negation in which we negate this initial negation and begin to dissolve the distance between the self and object in “ecstasy” or “intoxication.” In the ecstatic aesthetic moment, we “lose ourselves” in the beauty of the object. It is not that in this moment we truly cease to exist, but we do through aesthetic experience go beyond the union with the object felt in everyday experience to grasp the prior unity which made the union possible---the unity in absolute emptiness which the first negation had taken away.

It must be emphasized that this moment of ecstatic, intoxicated dissolution cannot stand on its own either. Just as we would not be able to have aesthetic experience if we remained frozen in disinterest, so we could not have an aesthetic experience if we dissolved all boundaries between the self and object. In order to have an aesthetic experience, there must be a subject and object which come into contact with one another, hence the complete aesthetic dissolution of the self would result in the loss of the possibility of the aesthetic. As in the ethical double negation, which does not end when one returns to the community out which one originated, the aesthetic double negation must be an incessant cycle if it is to maintain itself. For Watsuji, the ethical good is the continual growth and development of the cycle of double negation; the aesthetic good should therefore also be the growth and development of a harmony between the negation of distancing and the negation of dissolution. Aesthetic experience is a kind of approaching of the limit, whereby we return to the primordial unity of the subject and object without quite erasing the distinction between them. The subject and object experience a higher union without uniting and thereby eliminating all difference between one another.

Here, my theory of aesthetic experience can be differentiated from Edward Bullough’s superficially similar theory of aesthetics as a matter of “psychical distance.” In “ ‘Psychical Distance’ as a Factor in Art and an Æsthetic Principle,” Bullough illustrates his meaning with the example of a ship in a fog. To a sailor or passenger aboard a ship, fog is a deadly and frightening menace. However, occasionally when trapped in a fog we may “distance” ourselves from the situation, and suddenly “our practical interest snaps like a wire from sheer over-tension, and we watch the consummation of some impending catastrophe with the marveling unconcern of a mere spectator.”[^] The trick of art and aesthetics for Bullough is prevent either under-distancing or over-distancing. When under-distancing, we treat the aesthetic situation as a matter of practical concern. When over-distancing, we are entirely aloof from the situation. A properly aesthetic experience in one in which we come as close as possible without identifying our interests within the spectacle.

[^]: Bullough, Edward. “ ‘Psychical Distance’ as a Factor in Art and an Æsthetic Principle” in _Æsthetics: Lectures and Essays_ (London: Bowes & Bowes, 1957), p. 94.

Two critics of Bullough spring directly from what has been explained so far. First, while Bullough shows in his essay that he understand the difference between psychic distancing and its ecstatic payoff, but he does an inadequate job of differentiating these two phases of experience and explaining how the second results from the first. He focuses on the psychological pre-conditions for distancing rather than any particular qualities in the object which are able to appreciated. This gives his theory a slight overemphasis on the “subjective” side of the experience at the cost of the “objective” side of the experience. It matters not only how the sailor relates to the fog, but also that it is fog to which the sailor is relating.

Second, Bullough writes that the “antinomy of distance” in aesthetic experience requires “the _utmost decrease of Distance without its disappearance_” (100).[^] This is correct as far as it goes, but I wish to emphasize that what allows for this utmost decrease without disappearance is the dynamic nature of aesthetic experience. In aesthetic experience, it is not that the subject passively regards its object from a certain distance. Rather, the subject and the object are both carved out of a more primordial flux of proto-experiences according to a procedure that takes shape within time. The “distance” to which Bullough refers is not quite the same as the distancing referenced earlier in this chapter. It is much closer to what we called _aida_ [間][ja] (a spatio-temporal interval) or _aidagara_ [間柄][ja] (a persistent relationship) in the last chapter. It is out of the empty space of relations that subject and object are formed in opposition to one another. Our earlier references to “distancing” refer to the formation of that opposition; Bullough’s “distance” refers to the empty space of relations. The relation of the sailor to the fog is normally one of horror, but by navigating with their relational space, the sailor can reach a new position from which to appreciate the fog’s other qualities: its beauty, its stillness, its remoteness, its deceptiveness, etc. Aesthetic experience attempts to preserve the contours of the relational space between the subject and object by preventing their complete union while nevertheless allowing their underlying unity to be felt as a dynamic ecstasy.

[^]: Emphasis is Bullough’s.

###Meeting point of feeling in aesthetic judgment
We must be clear to distinguish the unity of the subject and _object_ from the unity of the self and _other_. The first is, strictly speaking, an aesthetic movement, and the second is an ethical movement. In practice, however, these two movements cannot be cleanly separated (a point emphasized by Nishida), but we find that the ethical movement is always prior to the aesthetic movement and must exist beforehand in order to make the aesthetic movement possible. On the other hand, the aesthetic movement, while posterior to the ethical movement, creates new possibilities for future ethical moments to explore and can lead to radical shifts in how the ethical movement is actualized. As a result, we find that we have to treat the two movements as interrelated, since the one is so often the ground of the other. 

If now we return to the question of subjectivity or objectivity of aesthetic judgment, we see why both answers were unsatisfying. Locating the aesthetic in either the subject or object will be unsatisfying because the aesthetic moment cannot be the product of either one singly. Whether we describe it as a neutral subject receiving the value of the object or the aesthetically-minded subject projecting value feelings onto a neutral object, we have separated the subject and object in a way that is unreflective of aesthetic experience. At the same time, we cannot completely abolish the difference between the subject and object, since to do so would preclude the possibility of the aesthetic moment. Rather, we must preserve aesthetic experience as a possibility that expresses the underlying unity of subject and object through their division and union.

A full exploration of the feeling of ecstasy will have to wait for the next chapter and our exploration of the subject constructed in aesthetic experience, but there are a few initial remarks that can be made here. If an aesthetic experience is properly crafted, we find ourselves at meeting point with the feeling of the creator of the experience, with those other members of the audience with whom we share the experience, and with the object of that experience. Though my feelings and the feelings of those others can be distinguished, in the aesthetic experience, they share a common root in the ecstasy unity underlying the moment. Hence it is improper to think of aesthetic experience as a “subjective” phenomenon in a simple sense. Aesthetic experience is precisely the sort of experience in which the subjective gives itself over to the object.

When we examine closely the phenomena of everyday experience we begin to find numerous examples in which the supposedly individual and atomic self seems to merge with others in aesthetic experience as a part of the aesthetic grasping of the object. These are moments in which the ego of the individual can be felt melting into the crowd as the crowd grasps the world before it. We experience such moments when we watch our home team score a crucial goal before the end of the game or when take part in any number of civic and religious functions from a Fourth of July parade to a wedding ceremony. The standpoint of traditional anthropology is to try to explain these events as deriving from individual drives and desires or the group’s need for unity and survival, but such explanations fail to connect the level of individual experience to the group imperative. But if the subject is something that is fundamentally connected to others then shared aesthetic feeling is possible, and shared aesthetic judgment will be comprehensible when we examine it in the next chapter.

###Bringing forth the between in theater
To bring focus to this discussion, let us concretely examine the theater, which is an art Watsuji’s analysis returned to several times throughout his career. Greek tragedy and Japanese Noh are closely related aesthetic forms that exhibit very clearly the pattern of psychic distancing and reintegration I described. Both are masked dramas which illustrate “the poetic crystallization of a privileged moment in the life of a hero, detached from its spatiotemporal context and projected into a dream universe.”[^] Both invite the audience to put themselves in the shoes of that hero while also observing at a distance the logical and aesthetic unity of the drama as a whole.

[^]: Said of Noh by René Sieffert as quoted in Pronko, Leonard Cabell. _Theater East and West_ (Berkeley: U. Cal. Press, 1967), p. 75. I believe this applies equally to Greek tragedy.

####Aristotle on the role of catharsis
Given Aristotle’s foundational role in our contemporary understanding of Greek theater, it is worth briefly reviewing his theory of aesthetics. For Aristotle, the goal of tragedy is catharsis. In his _Poetics_, he defines tragedy as,

> a representation of an action that is heroic and complete and of a certain magnitude […] through pity and fear it effects relief to these and similar emotions.[^]

[^]: Aristotle. _Poetics_, Section VI, Part II, 1449b in *Aristotle in 23 Volumes*, Vol. 23, trans. W.H. Fyfe (Cambridge, MA: Harvard U. Press), 1932.

Here “effecting relief” is a translation of [κάθαρσις][gr] (“cleansing” or “purging”). We may speculating that Aristotle means this as a defense of theater from Plato’s charge in Book X of the _Republic_ that because poets have no specialized knowledge there is no role for the imitative arts in a just society. The theory of catharsis shows us the importance of arts like the theater for the good life. In the _Politics_, Aristotle explains that aesthetic catharsis is equivalent to medical catharsis (a purgative), except that it flushes out the emotions rather than the body. The result of a catharsis of the emotions is “a pleasant feeling of relief” and “harmless delight to people.”[^] In other words, for Aristotle, we receive pleasure from theater by building up emotions appropriate to the work and relieving them through their exercise. Accordingly, much of Aristotle’s commentary on tragedy concerns the particular forms of plot and character that are most appropriate for such an emotional climax. To use Bullough’s terminology, both “over-distancing” and “under-distancing” are to be avoided. If we see an evil character succeed or a good character fail, we will react too negatively. If we see a good character succeed or an evil character punished, we will react too positively. Tragedy, therefore, requires that a character who is neither better nor worse than the audience makes a tragic mistake that leads to a crisis and its eventual resolution.

[^]: Aristotle. _Politics_, Book VIII, 1342a in *Aristotle in 23 Volumes*, Vol. 21, trans. W.H. Fyfe (Cambridge, MA: Harvard U. Press), 1932.

In comparison to the other theories considered here, Aristotle’s is somewhat narrow since it is concerned with very specific artforms, but on the other hand, it has an admirable depth of reflection, particularly considering his disadvantage of writing first. In our language, what makes the pleasure of catharsis possible is precisely the distancing of the ordinary self in the theater and the subsequent meeting point of feeling with the actor and one’s fellow members of the audience.

####Nietzsche and theater
In _A Study of Nietzsche_ (1913), Watsuji follows Nietzsche’s lead in describing the Dionysian intoxication of the audience of Greek tragedy,

> The inner life of the Dionysian audience enjoys the _same_ intoxication as that of the people who personally dance and sing; instead of expressing this joy with their entire bodies, however, they do so through the satyrs on the stage. There are no individuals there; the ego disappears and everyone melts into the root of nature. Accordingly, the distinction between the choral round dancers and the spectators exists solely as a fact of cognition and is by no means something that restricts inward fact. (636–7)[^]

[^]: Translations of _A Study of Nietzsche_ from David B. Gordon. _Self-Overcoming as the Overcoming of Modernity: Watsuji Tetsurō’s “A Study of Nietzsche” (1913) and Its Place in the Development of His Thought_. Doctoral thesis, University of Hawaii (1997).

Here Watsuji is not only relaying Nietzsche’s views but also advancing his own interpretation of the meaning of theater. For Nietzsche, there were two aspects of tragedy, the Apollonian and the Dionysian. The Greek god Apollo was associated with the sun, beauty, and rationality, whereas Dionysus was the god of the festival, wine, and madness. Nietzsche emphasized that both the Apollonian and Dionysian aspects of the tragedy were essential to its creative tension, but he tended to stress the Dionysian as an antidote to what he took to be a one-sided Apollonian emphasis in German culture. Both the Apollonian and Dionysian aspects of the drama ultimately served to conceal the fundamental truth of the unsatisfactoriness of reality, but through different methods. The Apollonian concealed the inherent pathos of reality in semblances of dreams, but Dionysian does so through intoxication. Where the Apollonian emphasizes the importance of individuality (dreams are uniquely private), in the Dionysian the individual is lost to the frenzy of the crowd. Notice also that in this passage, the dissolution described is not merely a dissolution of subject and object, but primarily a dissolution of the bounds of individuality for the dancers and spectators. The artistry of the dancers reveals itself to the audience as the difference between audience and artist begins to weaken. From the perspective of the later Watsuji, this means that the aesthetic moment of appreciation for the dance cannot be grasped apart from the ethical moment of solidarity between the dancers and the spectators. As Watsuji reads Nietzsche, in such events the flow of life becomes powerfully concentrated, such that the will to power of the artist begins to overflow and wash over the crowd. In the intoxication of the aesthetic moment, the fabrication that “I” am a substantive soul is exposed as a falsehood and the truth that life concentrates where it will is revealed.

####Watsuji’s “Mask and Persona”
In the title essay of the collection from 1937’s _Mask and Persona_, Watsuji further explores the relation of Japanese aesthetics to philosophical anthropology.[^] In it, he explores the paradoxical nature of the Noh mask. Noh is an indigenous Japanese theater form which is performed by a masked actor with a chorus, which makes it quite similar to ancient Greek theater. Noh emerged in the fourteenth century, and typical plots concern the intersection of the otherworldly with ordinary or historical personages. A skilled actor is able to cause his (traditionally, all Noh actors are male) mask to take on a variety of expressions by changing its angle and thus the shadows on its otherwise emotionally blank face. (See figure two below.) The five major categories of Noh masks are men, women, the elderly, spirits, and gods/demons, but there are many other subdivisions. The more overtly emotional the mask, the more difficult it is to show a variety of emotions. Thus, often a demon mask may only be employed at the climactic end of a play, whereas the mask of a ordinary woman might be employed throughout. The masks of Noh derive from Gigaku [伎楽][ja], an ancient form of masked dance that is now largely extinct. Both were preceded by Kagura [神楽][ja], the divine dances of the Shinto religion, the roots of which are recorded in the _Kojiki_ ([古事記][ja], 712) and _Nihonshoki_ ([日本書紀][ja], 720) as the mythological dances performed to lure the Sun Goddess Amaterasu out of her cave and restore light to the world.

On the one hand, typical Noh masks are completely blank and “washed clean” of all specific facial features. On the other hand, when employed dynamically by a skillful actor, these masks are able to come to life in a way not possible for other, more ostensibly realistic masks. From this Watsuji concludes that,

> A mask is just the facial surface which remains when the body and head are stripped away from the original physical person, but that mask acquired a body once again. The expressing of the person can be reduced to just the facial surface, but this reduced surface holds a power to freely restore itself to a body. Seen this way, the facial surface has a core significance for the existence of a person [*hito no sonzai* [人の存在][ja]]. It is not simply one part of the physical body, but it is none other than the seat of the subjective [*shutai-teki naru mono no za* [主体的なるものの座][ja]] that subdues the physical body for itself, that is, the seat of personality [*jinkaku* [人格][ja]]. (WTZ 17:293)

For Watsuji, there is a fundamental “mysteriousness” to the surface of the face which is neither reducible to a hidden face nor eliminable by Occam’s razor. This is the subject (_shutai_ [主体][ja]) which reveals itself as a personality (*jinkaku* [人格][ja], a translation of the Kantian *[Persönlichkeit][de]*, that which makes a person) through its expression (*hyōgen* [表現][ja], German *[Darstellung][de]*) in the world. The personality is a hybrid of the transcendental and phenomenal which according to Kyōto School philosophy is possible because of the emptiness of all things. Thus it is perfectly symbolized by the Noh mask, which though perfectly static and blank freely takes on whatever expression it needs to take on. In aesthetic experience the personality itself becomes an object of possible experience as the living surface of a mask. Paradoxically, it is the very inhumanity and immobility of the Noh mask which makes it such an excellent tool of art, because only such a radically decontextualized facial surface is able to lay bear the mechanism of emptiness by which the subject constructs itself in phenomena. Accordingly, a sort of threefold displacement takes place in Noh theater, in which the audience ecstatically place themselves in the personality of the actor, the actor places himself in the personality of the role he portrays, and, at the climactic hight of the play, the character places him or herself in the grip of possession by a spirit or ghost.

Watsuji does not limit himself to an explanation of Japanese culture in this essay but also begins to explore the role of the mask in the West. The English word “person” derives from the Latin _persona_, which is thought to have originally signified the mask which is worn by an actor in a drama:

> What we have thought about so far cannot but naturally bring to mind the *persona*. This word first meant the mask used in a drama. This meaning shifted, and since it meant the various roles in the drama, it became a word indicating the characters in the drama. This is the “*dramatis personae*.” […] However, persons each have their own roles and duties in society. Behaving according to one’s own persona is how one gets done what must be done. Therefore, in the case that one acts in another’s stead to get what must be done, one has become employed as the persona of the other. This being so, the persona must mean “personality” as the subject [_shutai_ [主体][ja]] of acts and the subject of rights. Thus, “mask” has become “personality.” 
>
> Now, the most vitally important point about the reason for this turnabout in meaning is that first “mask” had come to mean “role.” If masks were only seen as being merely a sculpted facial surface, such a meaning could not have arisen. It was rather because masks held the power to acquire living persons as their own bodies that they were able to be a role or to be a character. (WTZ 17:293--4)

In other words, we see from this aesthetic, historical transformation of mask into the person first that human beings locate the seat of their subjectivities in the facial surface. Second, because of this locating of the seat of subjectivity, it was possible for a mask to represent a particular role for a character to take or for a person to hold in society. Third, through the metonymy of such a role, we come to understand the personality as a whole. Again, if the person were wholly an individual, this process would be illogical. Similarly, if the person were merely an aspect of the collective, it would not have been possible for the facial surface to come to play such a role in the aesthetics of the Noh drama. What has happened in this linguistic transformation requires both the individuation of persons through the facial surface and the negation of such individual persons as mere holders of particular roles.

Nietzsche for his part makes similar observations about the important role of the mask in _Birth of Tragedy_, but for Nietzsche that which lies behind the mask must be divine:

>  all the famous figures of the Greek stage, Prometheus, Oedipus etc., are merely masks of the original hero, Dionysos. The fact that there is a deity behind all these masks is one of the essential reasons for the ‘ideal’ quality of those famous figures which has prompted so much astonishment.[^]

[^]: Nietzsche, Friedrich. _Birth of Tragedy and Other Writings_, trans. Ronald Speirs (Cambridge U. Press, 1999), §10, p. 51.

For Watsuji, the ideal is not so much the “god” hidden behind the mask as the mask itself. The mask becomes the seat of the subjective by revealing the dipolar nature of the personality behind it. That personality is always located in the betweenness of person and person, and so the roles it inhabits become a part of what it is in itself. To be a particular person means to have a particular set of overlapping relations with others. Masks work by highlighting particular role relations the person inhabits and so become synonymous with the person as a whole.

As for Noh, it clearly reveals the structure of the aesthetic moment as the overcoming of union and division. The motions of the actor are all tightly regulated and carefully prescribed, which creates a separation between the role and the actor who attempts to embody that role. The actor must detach himself from his ordinary concerns, as must the audience members who watch him. Having thus detached themselves, the Noh actor finds that he has taken on the self of the mask---not because of a Dionysian frenzy as in Greek drama but because of a more subtle form of intoxication. The ecstasy of Noh is the result of studied selflessness (*muga*, [無我][ja]), in which the character is possessed by a spirit even as the actor completely embodies his role by dissolving beneath the surface of the mask and the audience completely identifies with the pathos of the actor because of the dynamic negativity of the mask that he wears.

####Sakabe Megumi and Zeami
The Japanese philosopher [Sakabe][sc] Megumi ([坂部恵][ja], 1936--2009) was inspired by Watsuji’s “Mask and Persona” and expanded on its themes in his own writing. In his essay “Mask and Shadow in Japanese Culture: Implicit Ontology in Japanese Thought,” he attempts to explain that the boundary between self and other is especially ambiguous in Japanese culture. He notes that the word _omote_ (which can variously be written as 面, おもて, or 表) “means the mask, the face, but at the same time it also means the surface” (245). He goes on to write,

> What is surprising to me is that “_omote_,” with the connotation of surface, does not mean in the Japanese language or thought “the appearance” as opposed to some ideal entity (as in the case of Platonism) or to some real substance (as in the case of Kant’s “thing-in-itself”). (245–6)

What this shows is that the Japanese people did not make a sharp distinction between what is on the surface of a thing and its interior “reality.” Instead they saw the reality as being real only insofar as it was a surface.

Sakabe sees this characteristic of Japanese language also exhibited by Noh theater, in which “there is nothing but the play of various surfaces or various reflections” (247). For example, an important part of any Noh theater is the _kagami-no-ma_ [鏡の間][ja] (Mirror Hall), a room in which the Noh actor prepares for his role by envisioning himself as his character and in so doing “transmogrifies into the ultrahuman dimension of the spirit of the ancestors” (245). Exiting this space, “The actor enters the stage as a self transmogrified into an other, or as an other transmogrified into the self” (245). If self and other were truly opposed, then such a transformation would be as impossible as A being not-A at the same time, since it would never be possible for the self to be other to itself. “Self” is by definition itself and not its other. But if Watsuji is correct that self is the negating of a more primordial unity which can be reconstructed in a union of persistent relationships then the inversion whereby self becomes other and other becomes self is comprehensible as a dynamic reconfiguration of the structure of the actor’s human existence. The actor places his self into his mask and lets the mask be his self. This is the state necessary for a great performance.

Sakabe quotes Zeami Motokiyo ([世阿弥元清][ja], c. 1363--c. 1443), considered the founder of modern Noh aesthetics, who claims in his treatise _Kakyō_ [花鏡][ja] (“Flower-Mirror”) that a great actor must see himself with the eyes of the audience:

> To repeat again, an actor must come to have an ability to see himself as the spectators do, grasp the logic of this fact that the eyes cannot see themselves, and find the skill to grasp the whole---left and right, ahead and behind. If an actor can achieve this, his peerless appearance will be as elegant as that of a flower or a jewel and will serve as living proof of his understanding. (246–7)

Zeami refers to such seeing as _ri-ken no ken_ [離見の見][ja] or “the seeing of distant seeing.” As we have seen before, the preparatory step for a truly aesthetic experience is first the creation of psychic distance. In this case, the psychic distancing allows the actor to individuate himself as object of his own gaze. The actor steps outside of himself and observes himself from the point of view of the audience, creating yet another displacement of self in addition to the multiple displacements of the audience.

In _Theater East and West_, Leonard Pronko writes that

> If the actor must know himself, he must also know his public; Zeami deemed it of the utmost importance that an actor be constantly aware of the needs of his audience, and that he must answer those needs. (81--2)

When the actor is aware of himself and his audience, he creates the distance which allows the union of the audience and actor in a meeting point of feeling. In that meeting point, the audience become one with each other as their attention focuses on the artistry of the actor as the object of their experience, and the actor becomes one with them as he watches himself with the seeing of distant seeing. It is a meeting point in which the psychic distance between audience, actor, and art is minimized without ever quite collapsing. 

The core aesthetic value of Noh for Zeami and others is _yūgen_ ([幽玄][ja]), an untranslatable term of art. _Yūgen_ suggests darkness, depth, profundity, and mystery. It can be seen in the delicate play of shadows in the emotional space between the mask and audience. It is beautiful blurring of the hazy border that separates the selves of the actor, character, and audience. 

Pronko attempts to explain,

> The difficult term _yūgen_, suggested by the stylized beauty of the mask and the spiritual reality behind it, has been translated many different ways; indeed it is difficult to pin down, for Zeami used it with different meanings over a period of thirty-six years. The primary meaning of _yūgen_ is “the occult,” or as Waley translates it, “what lies beneath the surface.” […] _Yūgen_, no doubt attempts to describe something it can only suggest. If its essence cannot be defined, its results can least be experienced by those with sufficient sensitivity and background. (86)

Pronko is an excellent student of Japanese theater, but if Sakabe is to be believed, Pronko was led astray here by his Western vocabulary. _Yūgen_ can be translated as “the occult,” but this does not mean that what is being occulted is an essence hidden below the surface. _Yūgen_ is rather the way that the depths of the character are constructed entirely on the surface as a surface. Through interaction, an aesthetic subject is constructed as the negation of absolute nothingness. In the next chapter, we must explore this subject and the aesthetic judgments it makes at the meeting point of feeling.
