##Chapter 3. Aesthetic Experience and the Meeting Point of Feeling
###Aesthetic experience as distance and dissolution
Having understood the basics of Watsuji’s anthropology and hermeneutic method, we are now equipped to begin to ask what an aesthetic experience is. Although Watsuji focuses on describing the ethical moment as a “double negation” where we negate the unity of human existence through individualism then negate that negation through a return to the totality but now with the marks of cleavage, I will argue that we can extend that description beyond ethics to a description of aesthetic experience as a double negation. In the first negation, we create a psychic distance between the self and object and achieve a state that Kant calls “disinterestedness.” If the process stopped there, this would leave us cold and aloof from the world and would not constitute an aesthetic experience. However, this individuating negation is a necessary precondition of the double negation in which we negate this negation and begin to dissolve the distance between the self and object through “intoxication” or “ecstasy.” In the ecstatic aesthetic moment, we “lose ourselves” in the beauty of the object. It is not that in this moment we truly cease to exist, but we do through aesthetic experience come into union with the object and so grasp the prior unity which made the union possible. If this union is properly crafted, we find ourselves at meeting point with the feeling of the creator of the experience. Though my feelings and the feelings of the creator can be distinguished, in the aesthetic experience, they meet in the ecstasy of the moment.

It must be emphasized that this moment of intoxicated dissolution cannot stand on its own either. Just as we would not be able to have aesthetic experience if we remained frozen in disinterest, so we could not have an aesthetic experience if we dissolved all boundaries between the self and object. In order to have an aesthetic experience, there must be a subject and object which come into contact with one another, hence the complete aesthetic dissolution of the self would result in the loss of the possibility of the aesthetic. The aesthetic moment is a kind of approaching of the limit, whereby we return to the primordial unity of the subject and object without quite erasing the distinction between them. The subject and object experience union without uniting and thereby eliminating all difference between one another. The return to primordial unity is always a return with difference. By analogy, suppose we cleave apart a rock into two fragments, then cleave together those two parts. In doing so, we have returned the fragments to their origin but with a difference. The line of fissure between the two fragments will remain even as they reconstitute a single whole. The line of fissure shows the accumulation of history by the rock, even as its outer appearance remains the same. So too, the subject and object in union retain a difference from their original state even as they reclaim their former unity.

###Subjectivity and objectivity in aesthetic judgment
If now we return to the question of subjectivity or objectivity of aesthetic judgment, we see why both answers were unsatisfying. Locating the aesthetic in either the subject or object will be unsatisfying because the aesthetic moment cannot be the product of either one singly. Whether we describe it as a neutral subject receiving the beautiful object or the aesthetically-minded subject projecting feelings beauty onto a neutral object, we have separated the subject and object in a way that is unreflective of aesthetic experience. At the same time, we cannot completely abolish the difference between the subject and object, since to do so would preclude the possibility of the aesthetic moment. Rather, we must preserve aesthetic experience as a possibility that arises out of the prior unity of subject and object and expresses itself as their union in cleavage. 

Aesthetic judgment is an expression of aesthetic experience as a judgment, so it can only be made after the division of a subject from an object, but this division does not reflect the primordial nature of the subject and object, which are originally united. Nevertheless, we may characterize aesthetic judgment as “subjective” in the sense that the nature of the subject determines the nature of the aesthetic experience that is possible. The division and union that are constitutive of aesthetic experience are particular to a subject. However, unlike Kantian aesthetics, we need not appeal to a universal rational subject to bring communicability to our subjective aesthetic judgments, since for Watsuji, the subject is not isolated, but fundamentally relational and interconnected. As such, although aesthetic experience is the experience of particular subjects, it is not therefore a private experience. Where particular subjects “overlap,” even their otherwise personal judgments can be shared. The nature of the self as relational means that aesthetic experience can be deeply subjective but nevertheless communicable to other persons.

###The relation of subject-object as reflective of the relation of self-other
In describing the phenomenology of cleavage, we must also be clear to distinguish the union of the subject and _object_ from the union of the self and _other_. The first is, strictly speaking, an aesthetic movement, and the second is an ethical movement. In practice, however, these two movements cannot be cleanly separated, but we find that the ethical movement is always prior to the aesthetic movement and must exist beforehand in order to make the aesthetic movement possible. On the other hand, the aesthetic movement, while posterior to the ethical movement, creates new possibilities for future ethical moments to explore and can lead to radical shifts in how the ethical movement is actualized. As Watsuji writes, “a flower is said to be beautiful, but that it ‘is beautiful’ is based upon a specific manner of existence of a human being who finds it beautiful” (133). As a result, we find that we have to treat the two movements as interrelated, since the one is so often the ground of the other. The creation of psychic distance and its joining in intoxication is ultimately just one movement within the larger sphere of human existence, hence we must separately investigate its normative import (chapter 4), its historical milieu (chapter 5), and its relationship to religion (chapter 6) in order to fully grasp its significance.

The difference between self-other union and subject-object union is also responsibility for a difference between the performing arts and non-performing arts. In the plastic arts, one relates to some object and through that object one grasps seemingly indirectly the person responsible for the creation of the object. In the performing arts, the object to be grasped is in a certain sense the creator of the object. (This ignores for a moment the difference between the players and the actors in theater, for example, but ultimately if the players are true to the work, there will be no real difference.) In the ultimate view, however, the difference between the two kinds of art is only slight, for a great artist of the plastic arts is able to express her subjectivity in such a way as to make transparent to the viewer the subjective milieu which gave rise to the object. Nevertheless, because of this slight difference, it will be easier to begin a concrete exploration of aesthetic experience by looking at the performing arts.

###Bringing forth the between in theater
With this understanding of the aesthetic experience and judgment in mind, it is clear that the role of a philosopher-historian of art and culture like Watsuji is to categorize those methods which evolve historically and regionally by which the subject and object are first distanced from one another and second ecstatically united in order to grasp more precisely the unity which lies underneath them. These processes of subject-object interaction will in turn be driven by the self-other relations that make up the core of the subject. When we examine closely the phenomena of everyday experience we begin to find numerous examples in which the supposedly individual and atomic self seems to merge with others in aesthetic experience as a part of the aesthetic grasping of the object. This process may be called “the meeting point of feeling.” These are moments in which the ego of the individual can be felt melting into the crowd as the crowd grasps the world before it. We experience such moments when we watch our home team score a crucial goal before the end of the game or when take part in any number of civic and religious functions from a Fourth of July parade to a Christian Eucharist service. The standpoint of traditional anthropology is to try to explain these events as deriving from individual drives and desires or the group’s need for unity and survival, but such explanations fail to connect the level of individual experience to the group imperative. But if the subject is something that is fundamentally connected to others then shared aesthetic feeling is possible, and shared aesthetic judgment is comprehensible. 

To bring focus to this discussion, let us examine an example to which Watsuji returned several times throughout his career, that of theater. Greek tragedy and Japanese Noh are closely related aesthetic forms that exhibit very clearly the pattern of psychic distancing and reintegration I described. In _A Study of Nietzsche_ (1913) Watsuji follows Nietzsche’s lead in describing the Dionysian intoxication of the audience of Greek tragedy,

> The inner life of the Dionysian audience enjoys the _same_ intoxication as that of the people who personally dance and sing; instead of expressing this joy with their entire bodies, however, they do so through the satyrs on the stage. There are no individuals there; the ego disappears and everyone melts into the root of nature. Accordingly, the distinction between the choral round dancers and the spectators exists solely as a fact of cognition and is by no means something that restricts inward fact. (636–7)[^]

Here Watsuji is not only relaying Nietzsche’s views but also advancing his own interpretation of the meaning of the drama. For Nietzsche, there were two aspects of tragedy, the Apollonian and the Dionysian. The Greek god Apollo was associated with the sun, beauty, and rationality, whereas Dionysus was the mad god of the festival. Nietzsche emphasized that both the Apollonian and Dionysian aspects of the tragedy were essential to its creative tension, but he tended to stress the Dionysian as an antidote to what he took to be a one-sided Apollonian German culture. Both the Apollonian and Dionysian aspects of the drama ultimately served to conceal the fundamental truth of the unsatisfactoriness of reality, but through different methods. The Apollonian concealed the inherent pathos of reality in semblances of dreams, but Dionysian does so through intoxication. Where the Apollonian emphasizes the importance of individuality (dreams are uniquely private), in the Dionysian the individual is lost to the frenzy of the crowd. Notice also that in this passage, the dissolution described is not merely a dissolution of subject and object, but primarily a dissolution of the bounds of individuality for the dancers and spectators. The artistry of the dancers reveals itself to the audience as the difference between audience and artist begins to weaken. From the perspective of the later Watsuji, this means that the aesthetic moment of appreciation for the dance cannot be grasped apart from the ethical moment of solidarity between the dancers and the spectators. As Watsuji reads Nietzsche, in such events the flow of life becomes powerfully concentrated, such that the will to power of the artist begins to overflow and wash over the crowd. In the intoxication of the aesthetic moment, the fabrication that “I” am a substantive soul is exposed as a falsehood and the truth that life concentrates where it will is revealed. 

In 1937’s _Mask and Persona_, Watsuji further explores the relation of Japanese aesthetics to philosophical anthropology in the title essay of the collection. In it, he explores the paradoxical nature of the Noh mask. Noh is an indigenous Japanese theater form which is performed by a masked actor with a chorus, which makes it quite similar to ancient Greek theater. Noh emerged in the 14<sup>th</sup> century, and typical plots concern the intersection of the otherworldly with ordinary or historical personages. A skilled actor is able to cause his (traditionally, all Noh actors are male) mask to take on a variety of expressions by changing its angle and thus the shadows on its otherwise emotionally blank face. The five major categories of Noh masks are men, women, the elderly, spirits, and gods/demons, but there are many other subdivisions. The more overtly emotional the mask, the more difficult it is to show a variety of emotions. Thus, often a demon mask may only be employed at the climactic end of a play, whereas the mask of a ordinary woman might be employed throughout. The masks of Noh derive from Gigaku 伎楽, an ancient form of masked dance that is now largely extinct. Both were preceded by Kagura 神楽, the divine dances of the Shinto religion, the roots of which are recorded even in the earliest Japanese writings. Kagura survives in a number of different local forms today and is also used as the name for a style of dance within Noh.

On the one hand, typical Noh masks are completely blank and “washed clean” of all specific facial features. On the other hand, when employed dynamically by a skillful actor, these masks are able to come to life in a way not possible for other, more ostensibly realistic masks. From this Watsuji concludes that,

> A mask is just the facial surface which remains when the body and head are stripped away from the original physical person, but that mask acquired a body once again. The expressing of the person can be reduced to just the facial surface, but this reduced surface holds a power to freely restore itself to a body. Seen this way, the facial surface has a core significance for the existence of a person [*hito no sonzai* 人の存在]. It is not simply one part of the physical body, but it is none other than the seat of the subjective [*shutai-teki naru mono no za* 主体的なるものの座] that subdues the physical body for itself, that is, the seat of personality [*jinkaku* 人格].[^]

[^]: Translations from _Mask and Persona_ are my own. 

Watsuji does not limit himself to an explanation of Japanese culture here, but begins to explore the role of the mask in the West. As is well known, the English word “person” derives from the Latin _persona_, which is thought to have originally signified the mask which is worn by an actor in a drama:

> What we have thought about so far cannot but naturally remind one of its associations with “persona.” This word first meant the mask used in a drama. This meaning shifted, and since it meant the various roles in the drama, it became a word indicating the characters in the drama. This is the “dramatis personae.” […] However, persons each have their own roles and duties in society. Behaving according to one’s own persona is how one gets done what must be done. Therefore, in the case that one acts in another’s stead to get what must be done, one has become employed as the persona of the other. This being so, the persona must mean “personality” as the subject [_shutai_ 主体] of acts and the subject of rights. Thus, “mask” has become “personality.” 
>
> Now, the most vitally important point about the reason for this turnabout in meaning is that first “mask” had come to mean “role.” If masks were only seen as being merely a sculpted facial surface, such a meaning could not have arisen. It was rather because masks held the power to acquire living persons as their own bodies that they were able to be a role or to be a character. 

In other words, we see from this aesthetic, historical transformation of mask into the person first that human beings locate the seat of their subjectivities in the facial surface. Second, because of this locating of the seat of subjectivity, it was possible for a mask to represent a particular role for a character to take or for a person to hold in society. Third, through the metonymy of such a role, we come to understand the personality as a whole. Again, if the person were wholly an individual, this process would be illogical. Similarly, if the person were merely an aspect of the collective, it would not have been possible for the facial surface to come to play such a role in the aesthetics of the Noh drama. What has happened in this linguistic transformation requires both the individuation of persons through the facial surface and the negation of such individual persons as mere holders of particular roles.

Nietzsche for his part makes similar observations about the important role of the mask in _Birth of Tragedy_, but for Nietzsche that which lies behind the mask must be divine:

>  all the famous figures of the Greek stage, Prometheus, Oedipus etc., are merely masks of the original hero, Dionysos. The fact that there is a deity behind all these masks is one of the essential reasons for the ‘ideal’ quality of those famous figures which has prompted so much astonishment. (§10, p. 51)

For Watsuji, the ideal is not so much the “god” hidden behind the mask as the mask itself. The mask becomes the seat of the subjective by revealing the dipolar nature of the personality behind it. That personality is always located in the betweenness of person and person, and so the roles it inhabits become a part of what it is in itself. To be a particular person means to have a particular set of overlapping relations with others. Masks work by highlighting particular role relations the person inhabits and so become synonymous with the person as a whole.

As for Noh, it clearly reveals the structure of the aesthetic moment as the overcoming of division and union. The motions of the actor are all tightly regulated and carefully prescribed, which creates a separation between the role and the actor who attempts to embody that role. The actor must detach himself from his ordinary concerns, as must the audience members who watch him. Having thus detached themselves, the Noh actor finds that he has taken on the self of the mask--not because of a Dionysian frenzy as in Greek drama but because of a more subtle form of intoxication. The ecstasy of Noh is the result of studied selflessness, in which the actor completely embodies his role by dissolving beneath the surface of the mask and the audience completely identifies with the pathos of the actor because of the dynamic negativity of the mask that he wears.

The Japanese philosopher [Sakabe][sc] Megumi (坂部恵, 1936–2009) was inspired by Watsuji’s “Mask and Persona” and expanded on its themes in his own writing. In his essay “Mask and Shadow in Japanese Culture: Implicit Ontology in Japanese Thought,” he attempts to explain that the boundary between self and other is especially ambiguous in Japanese culture. He notes that the word _omote_ (which can variously be written as 面, おもて, or 表) “means the mask, the face, but at the same time it also means the surface” (245). He goes on to write,

> What is surprising to me is that “_omote_,” with the connotation of surface, does not mean in the Japanese language or thought “the appearance” as opposed to some ideal entity (as in the case of Platonism) or to some real substance (as in the case of Kant’s “thing-in-itself”). (245–6)

What this shows is that the Japanese people did not make a sharp distinction between what is on the surface of a thing and its interior “reality.” Instead they saw the reality as being real only insofar as it was a surface.

Sakabe sees this characteristic of Japanese language also exhibited by Noh theater, in which “there is nothing but the play of various surfaces or various reflections” (247). For example, an important part of any Noh theater is the _kagami-no-ma_ 鏡の間 (Mirror Hall), a room in which the Noh actor prepares for his role by envisioning himself as his character and in so doing “transmogrifies into the ultrahuman dimension of the spirit of the ancestors” (245). Exiting this space, “The actor enters the stage as a self transmogrified into an other, or as an other transmogrified into the self” (245). If self and other were truly opposed, then such a transformation would be as impossible as A being not-A at the same time, since it would never be possible for the self to be other to itself. “Self” is by definition itself and not its other. But if Watsuji is correct that self is the negating of a more primordial unity which can be reconstructed in a union of betweenness then the inversion whereby self becomes other and other becomes self is comprehensible as a dynamic reconfiguration of the structure of the actor’s humanity. The actor places his self into his mask and lets the mask be his self. This is the state necessary for a great performance.

Sakabe quotes Zeami, the fourteenth century founder of Noh, who claims in his treatise _Kakyō_ that a great actor must see himself with the eyes of the audience:

> To repeat again, an actor must come to have an ability to see himself as the spectators do, grasp the logic of this fact that the eyes cannot see themselves, and find the skill to grasp the whole--left and right, ahead and behind. If an actor can achieve this, his peerless appearance will be as elegant as that of a flower or a jewel and will serve as living proof of his understanding. (246–7)

Zeami refers to such seeing as _ri-ken no ken_ 離見の見 or the seeing of distant seeing. As we have seen before, the preparatory step for a truly aesthetic experience is first the creation of psychic distance. In this case, the psychic distancing allows the actor to individuate himself as object of his own gaze. The actor steps outside of himself and observers himself from the point of view of the audience. Having created this distance allows for the union of the audience and actor in a meeting point of feeling in which they become one with each other as their attention focuses on the artistry of the actor as the object of their experience. This is a meeting point of feeling in which the psychic distance between audience, actor, and art is minimized without ever quite collapsing.
