##Chapter 5. Art, History, and Milieu

####Contents:
<toc />

###Aesthetic Contexts
In the last chapter, we saw how communities of taste emerge from individual judgments, and vice-versa, individual judgments emerge from communities of taste. But where do these things come from and where do they go? Ie. How do we deal with the non-covergence of value in art? Science converges. Art mostly doesn't.

###Theories of art

  - Is art a Republic Book II-style intrinsic+extrinsic good? 
  - look at theories of art and conclude that the context cannot be neglected, the rest of the chapter is about context.

###History as temporal context
  - Time
  - There are at least three meanings of “history”.
    - 1. Everything that really happened.
    - 2. The important things that happened.
    - 3. How we recalled or are shaped by the past.
  - Hume on taste x history
  - Jusosei
    - shinmin no michi
    - Hegel (via Bellah via review): Those moments which the spirit appears to have outgrown still belong to it in the depths of its present. Just as it has passed through all its moments in history, so also must it pass through them again in the present.
    - PoMo

###Milieu as spatial context
  - Space
    - 空 as 空間性
    - Space as Aida
  - Talk about the book fūdo
    - fūdoki
    - Fūdo as travel literature
  - Seken as time-space bridge? Or save it for the Public/Private discussion of 6?
  - Complaining about cold in Hawaii
  - Humans are unique in that we live in every climate from Antarctica to the Sahara. Most lifeforms either can’t do that or they just go to the other climate directly without having to specifically adapt culturally.
  - Climate has similar issues with “subjectivity” and “objectivity.” Both of them are both psychic and regular.
  - Climate:History::Body:Spirit. In evolution, organisms adapt to and create a climate, changing their bodies as they do so, but as expression of the spirit of progression towards good.
  - For Watsuji, it’s not that the environment is a pool of resources to satisfy our own desires. Rather, the environment is a subjective space out which our desires emerge. Thus, Watsuji’s environmental ethics won’t be overly instrumental, even if he does seem to be anthropocentric.
    - We are interconnected both as agents and as observers. So, fūdo isn’t just a resource pool for us. We want fish because we have fish. We need to understand our “debts” to history and to climate.
    - It's not that Americans loved cars and built suburbs. They built roads and then loved their cars for taking them down those roads.
- Tea!
- Unclassified
  - Ancient Greeks and Easter Islanders are both dead, but it’s better to have been a Greek
  - Fūdo vs. Oku no Hosomichi as travel literature.
  - Takarazuka as a dialectical evolution.
    - All women as a response to all men
  - For Watsuji, even highly subjective phenomena like our gustatory desires arise out of a wider matrix:
- Temp
  - Spatial and temporal aspects of the subject
  - Post-modern multilayering, not sublation
  - Locating the genius in an ethos
