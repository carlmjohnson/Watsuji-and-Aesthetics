##Ethics as first philosophy
Following René Descartes and the subjective turn in philosophy, it has become usual to regard epistemology as the “first philosophy.” This is evident in the very title of Descartes’ most famous work: _Meditations on First Philosophy In Which the Existence of God and the Distinction between the Soul and the Body are Demonstrated_. Whatever else Descartes though of himself as doing in his _Meditations_, it was clear that the bulk of his project consisted in applying the epistemology he had previously set out in the _Discourse on Method_. This methodological assumption of Descartes continues to have an influence far beyond the small circle of those who accept his arguments for God or mind-body dualism. It is widely taken for granted that a proper investigation into the nature of a particular discipline such as aesthetics must begin with an investigation into what Immanuel Kant calls “the condition of the very possibility” of the discipline as a science. However, as natural as this starting point may seem, it is a historical aberration. Within the Western tradition the term “first philosophy” ([πρώτη φιλοσοφία][gr]) was originally coined by Aristotle to refer to the discipline now known as metaphysics. Hence it was widely accepted that an investigation into the nature of a discipline as a science could only be conducted once the _objects_ of that discipline had been properly categorized. 

In addition to these two approaches---which broadly speaking can be to characterize ancient and modern first philosophy in the West---there is another tradition in the East of taking practical concerns as having primary significance. For classical Indian philosophers (_āstika_ and _nāstika_ alike), the first questions to be resolved were soteriological, and out of these answers flowed quite sophisticated metaphysical, logical, and epistemic systems. For the ancient Chinese and the cultures they influenced, the first questions to be resolved were ethical and political. For example, when Confucius and Xunzi spoke about _zhengming_ [正名][ch] (using language properly), they did so not from the metaphysical standpoint of Socrates, who worries that his definitions conform to the eternal Forms, nor from the epistemological standpoint of David Hume, who traces ideas back to their original impressions, but from the standpoint of the socio-political effects certain patterns of usage will have within society.

In a modernist project, we might begin by relating aesthetics to knowledge and the question of how we as subjects obtain knowledge of it. In a more classical vein, we might begin by relating aesthetics to its objects by contrasting and connecting the internal objects of experience and the external objects of the world. Or perhaps we might begin by attempting to relate aesthetics to a larger soteriological or politico-ethical project, as Tolstoy does in "What Is Art?" Of course, whichever approach we choose to employ to describe aesthetics will by necessity be “impure” and contain elements of the other approaches. However,

Such an approach retains the modern subjective turn’s focus on the human being as the starting point of inquiry.

 In his _Meditations_, Descartes emphasizes the importance of individual, theoretical contemplation as over communal, practical action. Traditional philosophy had depicted praxis as the ladder to theoria,[^] but in the _Discourse on Method_, Descartes specifically renounces ethical inquiry and action. For Descartes, theory is the starting point, and practice follows.[^] However, it is made clear in the _Discourse_ that the greatest motivator of this paradigm shift is Descartes’ desire to forestall a repeat of the Galileo trials, rather than any specifically philosophical concern.[^] Nevertheless, Descartes approach in the _Discourse_ and _Meditations_ managed to accelerate the pre-existing trend toward a separation of theory and practice in Western philosophy. 

[^]: Literally so in Boethius' _Consolation of Philosophy_, in which the symbolic woman Philosophy wears a dress embroidered with a ladder from pi (praxis) to theta (theoria). Similarly, Pierre Hadot repeatedly emphasizes in _Philosophy as a Way of Life_ that the ancients considered theoretical insight to be an accomplishment over and above the primary achievement of practical action. <!-- §§ Boethius, Hadot-->
[^]: In spite of this somewhat unflattering portrait of Cartesian philosophy, it should also be pointed out that when Descartes titled his book _Meditations on First Philosophy_, he meant them to be quite literally meditations performed as a mental discipline. Nevertheless, even from this perspective, the contrast is instructive. For the ancient skeptics, the suspension of judgment was a life long endeavor. For Descartes, suspension of judgment was to be achieved in a single day of reflection.
[^]: Descartes introductory comment in *Discourse on Method* VI, "I finished the treatise containing all these matters; and I was beginning to revise it […] when I learned that persons to whom I greatly defer […] had condemned a certain doctrine in physics [viz. Galileo's heliocenterism…]; and this led me to fear lest among my own doctrines likewise some one might be found in which I had departed from the truth […]" makes clear the source of the first of Descartes' personal maxims listed in part III, "to obey the laws and customs of my country, adhering firmly to the faith in which, by the grace of God, I had been educated from my childhood and regulating my conduct in every other matter according to the most moderate opinions, and the farthest removed from extremes, which should happen to be adopted in practice with general consent of the most judicious of those among whom I might be living." He plainly saw that it was dangerous to be overtly heterodox and so moderated his ethical, practical considerations out of a prudential fear of negative consequences from challenging the authorities of his time.

In East Asia, such a trend was negligible in the pre-modern era.

Suppose, however, that a critic insists that logic, not ethics, is philosophically prior. Surprisingly, this critic will find an implicit opponent in Aristotle, whose defense of the law of non-contradiction ultimately grounds out in the concerns of the community:

> There are some who, as we said, both themselves assert that it is possible for the same thing to be and not to be, and say that people can judge this to be the case. And among others many writers about nature use this language. But we have now posited that it is impossible for anything at the same time to be and not to be, and by this means have shown that this is the most indisputable of all principles.---Some indeed demand that even this shall be demonstrated, but this they do through want of education, for not to know of what things one should demand demonstration, and of what one should not, argues want of education. For it is impossible that there should be demonstration of absolutely everything (there would be an infinite regress, so that there would still be no demonstration); but if there are things of which one should not demand demonstration, these persons could not say what principle they maintain to be more self-evident than the present one.
>
> We can, however, demonstrate negatively even that this view is impossible, if our opponent will only say something; and if he says nothing, it is absurd to seek to give an account of our views to one who cannot give an account of anything, in so far as he cannot do so. For such a man, as such, is from the start no better than a vegetable.[^]

[^]: Aristotle, _Metaphysics_, tr. W. D. Ross. Book Γ, part 4. 

In other words, for Aristotle the ultimate grounds of logic as an metaphysical enterprise are the grounds of discourse among fellow human beings. [Λόγος][gr] is an account, and accounts are given among and between human beings. To discover the rules of logic must be an anthropological project. With the person who will not abide by the law of non-contradiction we cannot have a productive conversation, and so for that reason we may say that in a certain sense the communal understanding that allows for discourse must come even before logic in philosophical priority.

If this is the case for logic, it is also the case for epistemology as well. While the difficulties with defining knowledge as a “justified, true belief” are well-known at this point, the core of any knowledge claim is inevitably that one purports to have a _trustworthy_ belief or ability. The standards for trustworthiness maybe personal so long as we are relying on this knowledge for our own purposes alone, however, so soon as we would ask others to trust this purported knowledge as well (which is of course the meaning of science as a human enterprise), we have entered into the realm of ethics.

Without beginning from a basis in practice, one would lack the data necessary to classify the objects of aesthetic inquiry, since it through practice that we come to discriminate among those objects, hence a metaphysical approach to first philosophy must nevertheless be backstopped through practice. Similarly, without beginning from a basis in practice, it would be impossible to determine how aesthetic knowledge is created, since it through practice that we recognize together what counts as having justified our true beliefs. Thus, an epistemological approach to first philosophy will also ground out in a certain sense in an account of what justifies us to others when we make knowledge claims. Accounts of practice and justification are, of course, questions that fall under the domain of ethics. It follows that our philosophical anthropology must begin by accounting for active, practical aspect of humankind (“What ought I to do?”) before it can adequately address Kant’s other two questions.

For example, Seizō [Sekine][sc] objects in _A Comparative Study of the Origins of Ethical Thought_ that, “even Watsuji cannot help put proffer a transcendental principle” because “trust is based on laws of human existence, while betraying trust is contrary to these laws, which is exactly why it was prohibited” (138). This objection has merit, but to call Watsuji’s central ethical principle “transcendental” is to miss the point somewhat. As Hall and Ames define it in _Thinking Through Confucius_,

> Strict transcendence may be understood as follows: a principle, _A_, is transcendent with respect to that, _B_, which it serves as principle if the meaning or import of _B_ cannot be fully accounted for without recourse to _A_, but the reverse is not true. (_Thinking Through Confucius_, 13)

Under this definition, Watsuji’s ultimate ethical principles are not as Sekine suggests “transcendent,” because such principles are understood by and through human action as well as being the source of human action. Watsuji explains:

- - - -

As Sekine rightly notes, Watusji’s ethics turns on what will be explained to be a return to authenticity in double negation. However, properly understood one must also see that for Watsuji, authenticity is not an independent _A_ explaining the _B_ of normativity without being explained by it. 

- - - -

When we look back at the problem of subject-object relations in aesthetic experience with Watsuji’s insights in mind, we see that the question of whether the object is beautiful or it is the subject who sees the object as beautiful assumes a separation of subject and object that may not correspond to reality. Watsuji has told us that the line between self and other is only indistinct. Might the same also be true of the line between subject and object? That is, if both the subject and object are artifacts of a more primordial betweenness, then any line drawn with the subject on one side and the object on the other will, in its being drawn, act to determine some of the qualities of the subject and object. The implications of this process will be explored in greater depth in the next chapter.

[^] [^]: That it is _bi_ which is studied is particularly noteworthy because it means the beautiful adjectivally rather than a Greek conception of Beauty as a freestanding noun. This has the effect of relating Japanese _bigaku_ always to the context of the beautiful rather than an abstracted study of beauty divorced from contextuality.

- - - -

The difference between self-other union and subject-object union is also responsibility for a difference between the performing arts and non-performing arts. In the plastic arts, one relates to some object and through that object one grasps seemingly indirectly the person responsible for the creation of the object. In the performing arts, the object to be grasped is in a certain sense the creator of the object. (This ignores the difference between the players and the author in theater, for example, but ultimately if the players are true to the work, there will be no real difference.) In the ultimate view, however, the difference between the two kinds of art is only slight, for a great artist of the plastic arts is able to express her subjectivity in such a way as to make transparent to the viewer the subjective milieu which gave rise to the object. Nevertheless, because of this slight difference, it will be easier to begin a concrete exploration of aesthetic experience by looking at the performing arts.

The topic of this paper is, broadly speaking, “taste” or “aesthetics,” but some clarification of these terms is needed, since this is comparative dissertation that will examine Japanese, Classical Chinese, and Western concepts. Aesthetics in particular has a certain ambiguity that is reflected by the fact that it can be translated into Japanese in at least two distinct manners. One translation of aesthetics, _bigaku_ 美学, is a Sino-Japanese compound meaning literally “the study of the beautiful.” (That it is _bi_ which is studied is particularly noteworthy because it means the beautiful adjectivally rather than a Greek conception of Beauty as a freestanding noun. This has the effect of relating Japanese _bigaku_ always to the context of the beautiful rather than an abstracted study of beauty divorced from contextuality.) Another translation of aesthetics into Japanese is as _kansei_ 感性, which might also be rendered into English as “sensibility.” This second translation is perhaps closer to the root Greek word [αἰσθάνομαι][gr], “I perceive.” Unlike the neutral “sense” or “perception,” however, the _kan_ part of _kansei_ strongly implies the feeling of emotion or value, not merely valueless sense data. For the purposes of this study, the question is how it is possible for something like _kansei_, our individual value feelings, to be the basis of _bigaku_, what is felt to be beautiful as such. “Taste” is the name we give to that ability which converts from the one aesthetic order to the other: _kansei_ to _bigaku_. By refining our taste, we widen our sensibilities in order to make sharper judgments of the values inherent in the world around us. At the same time, we must also resolve the question of whether taste as an appreciation of the beautiful can be separated from other forms of value judgment, such as the ethical and the political.

> ***OED aesthetic, adj. and n.*** Etymology:  mod. < Greek αἰσθητικ-ός , of or pertaining to αἰσθητά , things perceptible by the senses, things material (as opposed to νοητά things thinkable or immaterial), also ‘perceptive, sharp in the senses’; < vb. stem αἰσθε- ‘feel, apprehend by the senses’. Applied in German by Baumgarten (1750–58, Æsthetica) to ‘criticism of taste’ considered as a science or philosophy; against which, as a misuse of the word found in German only, protest was made by Kant (1781, Crit. R.V. 21), who applied the name, in accordance with the ancient distinction of αἰσθητά and νοητά , to ‘the science which treats of the conditions of sensuous perception,’ a sense retained in the Kantian philosophy, and found in English c1800. But Baumgarten's use of æsthetik found popular acceptance, and appeared in English after 1830, though its adoption was long opposed. (See below.) Recent extravagances in the adoption of a sentimental archaism as the ideal of beauty have still further removed æsthetic and its derivatives from their etymological and purely philosophical meaning. ‘The pronunciations /ɛsˈθɛtɪk/ , /iːsˈθɛtɪk/ , /ɛsˈθiːtɪk/ , /iːsˈθiːtɪk/ , are all in use; the second is at present most common in London’ ( N.E.D., 1884).

Kant in the third critique declares that, "_Beauty_ is an object's form of *purposiveness* insofar as it is perceived in the object *without the presentation of a purpose*."[^] The final clause about the "presentation of a purpose," refers to the fact that aesthetic experience is disinterested, as was discussed previously. A beautiful object, like the stars, does nothing to advance our own practical projects. "Purposiveness" in turn is a form of causation by which a concept plays a causal role in the coming into being of an object. To give an Aristotelian example, shelter might cause a builder to bring a house into being, hence the house is purposive. From the point of view Humean causation, purposiveness is, in a sense, backwards, because something which exists temporally later (shelter) causes something to happen earlier (the builder begins building), whereas causation ought to be a constant conjunction in association between things earlier in time and things later in time. In order to iron out the wrinkles in this sequence, Kant might say instead that the *concept* of shelter preceded the construction, though the *reality* of shelter came only later. However, Kant also defines the beautiful as "what, without a concept, is liked universally."[^]

	- Kant on Purposiveness
    - Ends vs. Means, Intrinsic value vs. Instrumental value, is the core of what it is to have Kantian disinterest. The disinterested view just "lets it be." Watsuji is similar, but for him being is doing. How you go about letting it be is active, not contemplative. Think about fanfic and fan-wikis and fannon. These things show that "letting it be" means "letting it do."





Aesthetic judgment is an expression of aesthetic experience as a judgment, so it can only be made after the division of a subject from an object, but this division does not reflect the primordial nature of the subject and object, which are originally united. Nevertheless, we may characterize aesthetic judgment as “subjective” in the sense that the nature of the subject determines the nature of the aesthetic experience that is possible. The division and union that are constitutive of aesthetic experience are particular to a subject. However, unlike Kantian aesthetics, we need not appeal to a universal rational subject to bring communicability to our subjective aesthetic judgments, since for Watsuji, the subject is not isolated, but fundamentally relational and interconnected. As such, although aesthetic experience is the experience of particular subjects, it is not therefore a private experience. Where particular subjects “overlap,” even their otherwise personal judgments can be shared. The nature of the self as relational means that aesthetic experience can be deeply subjective but nevertheless communicable to other persons.

In exploring the role of community in creating aesthetic normativity, we had to come to a greater understanding of the nature of subject as communal. However, it is not enough to see this enlarged subject as something disembodied which passively observes the world from a distance through the eyes of the individuals that make it up. We must remember that the subject through which we grasp aesthetic experience should not been seen as a Kantian _cogito_ appended to each of our internal presentation of objects. Rather, the subject is an active subject that inhabits this world physically:

> The attempt to consider "consciousness" by means of epistemology or psychology originates with the modern ego-consciousness, which divides the individual into body and mind and deals with the mind separately from the body. […] But the position of the _cogito_, which takes body as mere "matter," should be submitted to severe criticism. The body is not merely the same as any other object but is basically something subjective. As an observer of phenomena, one's eye is not matter as an object but is observing as a subject. Even the hand of an acting person is not an objective matter but the hand of an acting person. Moreover, apart from the subjective physical body, no human relationships could arise at all. (152)

> Exactly what he means here by ‘the moment of negation’ is the critical point. My argument will be that he does *not* simply mean that these arts have as a characteristic of them what is sometimes called ‘negative expression’---that is, the prolonged silences and empty spaces that can be found in them. That is, they do not simply provide us with some kind of aesthetic embodiment of [μὴ ὄν][el], the Nihil, or ontological negation. Watsuji, I think, has a more sophisticated view and in it the meaning of ‘negation’ is intimately linked to the notion of emptiness as co-dependent origination. (246)

Truth vs. normativity
WTZ10:286–7 真理 is subjective first and only becomes the noematic contemplative truth later.

> If rational truth (真理) is supposed to mean the truth of episteme, then this rational truth **born only of the union of the intellect and the will**, that is, the two sides of mere rationality. Thus, rational truth means a problem of the correspondence of the logical and the ethical. This is the basic law (根本法則) of rational truth. WTZ10:287

> Here, relations between human beings decide the issue of truth or falsehood, not the relation between a fact and a word. 274

> To deceive another person is a betrayal of trust. It cannot occur at a place where there is no trust. 274

> In such cases, _makoto_ is more than the congruence of a fact with a word or of a word with a deed, even though congruence of this sort is expected as a matter of course at the place where _makoto_ occurs. 275

Annette Baier in "Trust and Antitrust" explains many of the relevant properties of trust which also underlie this case. First, trust is to be distinguished from mere reliance. A prisoner may eat the food given by a torturing guard because there is no choice, but this is a situation of mere reliance, not trust. The prisoner cannot take for granted the food will not be poisoned or laced with psychoactive drugs, and prisoners who comes to trust their guards too readily are acting wrongly. A prisoner who suffers harm at the hands of a guard may be disappointed but this disappointment of desires or even expectations cannot be called a betrayal of trust. Trust goes beyond bare reliance to a "reliance on others’ competence and willingness to look after, rather than harm, things one cares about which are entrusted to their care" (Baier 1986: 259). In most cases in life, we exercise this trusting reliance unconsciously and without any specifically delimited expectations of what we trust the trusted person to do. Because of its open ended nature, trusting someone always involves an element of discretion that must be exercised by the trusted party:

> Suppose I look quickly around me before proceeding into the dark street or library stacks where my business takes me, judge the few people I discern there to be nondangerous, and so go ahead. We can say that my bodily safety, and perhaps my pocketbook, are the goods I am allowing these people to be in a position to threaten. I trust them, it seems, merely to leave me alone. But this is not quite right, for should a piece of falling masonry or toppling books threaten to fall on my head, and one of these persons leap into action and shove me out of this danger, I would regard that as rather more than less than I had trusted these strangers to do---a case for gratitude, not for an assault charge, despite the sudden, unceremonious, possibly painful or even injurious nature of my close encounter with my rescuer. (Baier 1986: 237)

On the other hand, consider a similar case where a stranger with perfectly good intentions suddenly prevents our smoking a cigarette by soaking us with water, eating an unhealthy food by snatching it from us, or walking obliviously down a dark alley by giving us a fright to teach us a lesson about being more aware. In these situations, the trusted party has exceeded the bounds of the trust relationship in spite of acting out of good intentions with the interests of the trusting party in mind. Thus, the reliance of the trusting party and the good will of the trusted party are not enough by themselves to constitute a properly functioning trust relationship. Trust relationships are mediated by socially acceptable roles and unspoken understandings. Indeed, under certain circumstances we might even grudgingly forgive such uncouth interventions if they came from an intimately trusted party, like a spouse or a parent. But without a deeper connection to the trusted party, such behaviors are gross violations of trust.

Baier proposes a test for evaluating the moral decency of a trust relationship, "that its continuation need not rely on successful threats held over the trusted, or on her successful cover-up of breaches of trust" (Baier 1986: 255). More generally, she explains that, "A trust relationship is morally bad to the extent that either party relies on qualities in the other which would be weakened by the knowledge that the other relies on them" (Baier 1986: 255–6). In other words, a good trust relationship is one which could survive the publicizing of the mechanisms which underlie the perpetuation of the relationship. One does not feel betrayed to learn that a police officer has a cash incentive to serve the public in addition to a sense of good will, but one would be devastated to learn one’s spouse was accepting payments to remain in the marriage. Conversely, one is gratified to learn of the erotic attachment of a spouse to one’s body but revolted and frightened to learn of the same motivation driving a police officer. What sorts of motivations are acceptable or unacceptable for the maintenance of a trust relationship depends on the social construction of that relation.

As Baier points out, any time trust is brought into question, it suffers even if it passes the test. In some cases,

> it may well be that the attempt to apply [the test of trust] will ensure its failing the test. Trust is a fragile plant, which may not endure inspection of its roots, even when they were, before the inspection, quite healthy. […] But to trust one's trust and one's distrust enough to refrain from applying moral tests until prompted by some distrust is to take a very risky bet on the justice, if not the ‘civilization,’ of the system of trust one inhabits. We may have to trade off civilization for justice, unless we can trust not only our trust but, even more vitally, our distrust. (Baier 1986: 260)

One common flaw for artist-centric theories is that the processes involved in the creation of art have many side-effects which do not count as artworks. It may be that the artist creates an artwork through sweat and tears, but the sweat and tears are not themselves artworks. Neither is a great artist creating art when in the restroom. In order to distinguish things that the artist makes which are art from those that are not, we must look at the artwork.

For example, many of the mid-twentieth century art movements in America were centered around the theory that a good painting is a painting in which certain formal qualities were balanced in a particular way. For this reason, the critic Clement Greenberg praised the work of Jackson Pollock, since it invited the viewer to *just look* at the canvas without interpolating any interpretations of the meaning of the work. The formal qualities of the work were felt to stand or fall on their own merits apart from the life of the painter or the meaning of the work. In a more surrealist vein, René Magritte’s *[La trahison des images][fr]* confronts us with the fact that we are looking at a painting of a pipe and a pipe itself, thus inviting us to consider it as a formal arrangement of pigments on canvas. 

In spite of the narrow meaning of “formalism” within art theory, we might also classify theories of art that focus on shared properties and patterns common to superior works of art as formal cause theories. Thus, theories about the proper contents for artworks are “formal” theories in this broader sense of “formal.” For example, it was a widely held opinion in French salons early in the nineteenth century that paintings or sculptures which deal with mythological or historical events are more artistically valuable than those that deal with still life or landscapes, but over the course of the century, this opinion was reversed. By the mid-twentieth century, it was widely felt by elite critics that the best content for a painting was no content; abstract painting was considered superior to representational painting. This shifting of opinions can be seen as a historical process in which new formal theories replace old ones. Whatever particular kind of content it is that critics favor at a given time, the fact they are classifying things as more or less artistic according to the similarity of the works to some ideal means that all of these theories are focused on the formal causation of the work.
