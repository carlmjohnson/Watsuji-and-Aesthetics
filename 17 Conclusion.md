##Chapter 7. Concluding Remarks
###Unifying themes
To conclude, I would like to review what has been proposed so far before leaving it to reader for further judgment. Looking back, it is clear that the unifying theme of these chapters has been the application of Watsuji's anthropology of double negation to aesthetics. Aesthetics has been consistently revealed as a process of unity/division/combination (*tōitsu/bunri/ketsugō* [統一・分離・結合][ja]) understood through a hermeneutic of restoration/construction/destruction (*kangen/kōsei/hakai* [還元・構成・破壊][ja]).

In the first instance, aesthetic experience was shown to be a interplay of subject and object. In ordinary experience, we experience a fusion of subject and object as we act, but this pre-reflective fusion is not true aesthetic experience. Aesthetic experience requires that we first distance the ordinary self from the object so that we no longer see it aspectivally as a component of the self. Once this negation is in place, a further negation is possible, the negation of intoxicated dissolution. In the second negation, we leave the ordinary self in its distance from the object but take up a perspective that is larger than ordinary self---the perspective of the no-self (*muga* [無我][ja]). From this larger perspective, rather than seeing the object aspectivally "as" useful for some practical end, we see the object "as if" it had practical value---we see the object as intrinsically valuable in its own perspective. For this reason, it is appropriate to label the process of aesthetic experience as a whole "disinterested enjoyment." Disinterested enjoyment does not mean enjoyment that is aloof from things, but enjoyment that comes from inhabiting the perspective of things rather than inhabiting the perspective of the ordinary self.

Aesthetic normativity as expressed in judgment and taste was similarly shown to be the result of double negation. This double negation takes place between self and other as well as the subject and object negation of aesthetic experience. The individual develops a unique sensibility by forming aesthetic judgments that contradict the taste of the community, but the taste of the community is the matrix out of which aesthetic experiences are made possible, so these tastes hold normative significance for the individual. My judgments stem from the tastes of others and must return to them to bear fruit. The basis for this process is not universal subjectivity, but a local and connected one. It is not that there is a singular ideal of the "suitable spectator" that holds for all aesthetic judgments across time. Rather, we create a subject suitable for aesthetic experience together and in so doing also give birth to the aesthetic predicates that our community takes as norms. The tastes of my community are normative for me because they made my experiences possible, and my judgments are normative for them because I am an autonomous member of our community. The sphere of the aesthetic expands at the speed of sound---by speaking together we create a space in which suitable subjects and ideal objects can flourish.

Our understanding of theories of art is also enhanced by looking through the lens of double negation. Artist, work, and audience must come together in a particular time and place in order to create art. Art is the concretion of a context. It is the blossoming of a historical pursuit of aesthetic excellence within a particular milieu. History is a process by which time is invested with significance through the interplay of works and styles. A milieu is enriched by the interplay of humanity and nature within a socio-ecological niche. Individual artworks are created out of the ideals of a context, which they negate, and in so negating they create a context of new ideals for new works to negate.

Finally, genius as well is a process of double negation. The genius is neither the artifact of sheer individual will nor the predetermined product of nature. It is the outcome of an interplay with critics. A true genius is one who smashes up old values that have grown into mere idols and reveals the shining core of truth that comes from the flow of life itself. In doing so, the private values of the genius become public and thereby risk their own idolization. When this happens, it is time for a new genius to revive the old idols and bring new life to the values they once represented.

In *The Study of Ethics*, Watsuji writes, “The highest value is an absolute totality, and an ‘aspiration’ (an upward impulse or fervent wish) for it is ‘good’ (_zen_ [善][ja])” (WTZ 10:142). This expresses as well my attitude towards aesthetics. The highest value of aesthetics is an absolute unity. Because it is absolute, it encompasses all---the good and bad, the beautiful and ugly, the subtle and the sublime. All is unity at the cosmic level. This is, abstractly speaking, the highest value, but aesthetic good is not content to merely allow this absolute to exist abstractly. Aesthetic goodness consists of the fervent movement towards absolute unity. We leap up out of ourselves and towards the other and the object without snuffing the ordinary self out of being. We eagerly anticipate the next phase in the ceaseless movement of double negation, and we cheer it along through our conscious efforts in acting with others.

###Objections to double negation
On the whole, therefore, I believe that Watsuji's anthropology and logic of double negation has shown itself quite fruitful at explaining aesthetic phenomena. Nevertheless, there are two immediate objections to this system which I wish to address here. The first is that this system overly broad, so that it can encompass anything and everything. The second is that it is nothing but a restatement of Hegel's logic of dialectic.

I believe the first objection may be rebutted by the fact that the system I have worked out is not contentless. Rather, there are many areas where my system objects to other popular conceptions of aesthetics. Unlike systems where the "suitable spectator" is so disinterested in the object to be disengaged, I insist that aesthetic experience is a deeper level of engagement with the object, but an engagement that takes place on the terms of the object rather than on the terms of the ordinary self. Against those systems which seek a universal basis for aesthetic normativity, I insist that aesthetic norms are rooted in the communities that gave birth to the subject and object. Unlike theories of art that try to find a singular basis for aesthetics in the artist, work, or audience, I insist that our understanding of art must take into account the context in which artist, work, and audience meet. Unlike theories of genius that try to make the genius into an individual force asserting itself against nature, I insist that the assertion of the genius is only one move in a larger double negation of public and private values between genius and critic.

The logic of double negation seems broad because it is so central to human existence. Because our lives our lived in ceaseless negation, it is natural that we can find examples of it all around us. However, double negation is not a contentless system. It insists that stasis and stoppage are death, and it resists the reification of non-substantive moments within a large movement.

The answer to that first objection should make it clear also why this system cannot be confused with mere Hegelian dialectic. Hegelian dialectic is process that evolves in a certain pre-determined pattern. Thesis and antithesis contain within them the logic of their synthesis, and the final synthesis is the ultimate goal of the absolute spirit. In Hegelian dialectic, the spirit gains greater and greater concreteness and objectivity as time goes on. Double negation has no predetermined end. While the highest value lies in totality, this does not determine the direction of its movement. Its direction is determined by the negations applied by the individuals and communities who act within it. When I as an individual in a persistent relationship assert myself as an individual, I alter the path of history. When I negate my individuality to preserve that persistent relationship, I give it a life and value that it would otherwise lack. History has no endpoint in double negation---and no guarantees that our movement will continue. It could be that the movement ceases and badness results. Still, as long as we breath, we hope; and as hopeful beings we must work diligently to allow the movement of human existence to continue.

###Addressing our initial concerns
  - 7 subj/objs
  - What is "Subjective"?
    - Internal/external
  - what is a suitable spectator
  - Two intuitions
  - Eye of the beholder?

- Interpretations 4/5 were ALL ASSUMING S/O DUALITY ANYWAY!
- The eye of the beholder is in the beauty.
- Self-other/subject-object
  - Goats don't feel beauty of the mountain, in part because they don't talk
  - The possibility of self-other is important: the subj/obj is within a self/other space (aida)
  - "Fever to tell" distinguishes the aesthetic attitude from others
- RESPOND: First, as seen, without any common object shared by different participants in a discussion, it is not possible for any mutual discussion of aesthetics to take place. This is contradicted by our experience, in which aesthetics *is* fruitfully discussed, at least some of the time. Second, in the limit, there will be no ability for one to cultivate one’s aesthetic judgment, since there will be nothing outside of a momentary, subjective experience to appeal to in the cultivation of one’s taste
- The sphere of aesthetic discussion expands at the speed of sound: discussing aesthetics makes discussion of aesthetics possible. 

###Comparison to historical approaches
  - Criticizing Plato and Kant
  - Plato's vision of the good was borderline totalitarian; he needs an individualizing moment!
  - Kant got the questions right, but he needed to see that his universal reason is a logos that people make by talking to each other.

###Future directions
  - Kant on art instruction
  - On hermeneutics
  - Is it too anthropomorphic?
  - Space vs. time
  - Truth vs. trust
  - A full theory of art
  - Religion, beauty and the good
  - More deconstruction
