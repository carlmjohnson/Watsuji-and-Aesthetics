##Chapter 7. Concluding Remarks
###Unifying themes
To conclude, I would like to review what has been proposed so far before leaving it to reader for further judgment. Looking back, it is clear that the unifying theme of these chapters has been the application of Watsuji's anthropology of double negation to aesthetics. Aesthetics has been consistently revealed as a process of unity/division/combination (*tōitsu/bunri/ketsugō* [統一・分離・結合][ja]) understood through a hermeneutic of restoration/construction/destruction (*kangen/kōsei/hakai* [還元・構成・破壊][ja]).

In the hermeneutic step of restoration of everyday experience, aesthetic experience was shown to be a interplay of subject and object. In ordinary experience, we experience a fusion of subject and object as we act, but this pre-reflective fusion is not true aesthetic experience. Aesthetic experience requires that we first distance the ordinary self from the object so that we no longer see it aspectivally as a component of the self. Once this negation is in place, a further negation is possible, the negation of intoxicated dissolution. In the second negation, we leave the ordinary self in its distance from the object but take up a perspective that is larger than ordinary self---the perspective of the no-self (*muga* [無我][ja]). From this larger perspective, rather than seeing the object aspectivally "as" useful for some practical end, we see the object "as if" it had practical value---we see the object as intrinsically valuable in its own perspective. For this reason, it is appropriate to label the process of aesthetic experience as a whole "disinterested enjoyment." Disinterested enjoyment does not mean enjoyment that is aloof from things, but enjoyment that comes from inhabiting the perspective of things rather than inhabiting the perspective of the ordinary self.

In the hermeneutic step of construction, I looked at the subject and object as built up in aesthetic normativity and theories of art. Aesthetic normativity as expressed in judgment and taste was similarly shown to be the result of double negation. This double negation takes place between self and other as well as the subject and object negation of aesthetic experience. The individual develops a unique sensibility by forming aesthetic judgments that contradict the taste of the community, but the taste of the community is the matrix out of which aesthetic experiences are made possible, so these tastes hold normative significance for the individual. My judgments stem from the tastes of others and must return to them to bear fruit. The basis for this process is not a universal subjectivity, but a local and connected one. It is not that there is a singular ideal of the "suitable spectator" that holds for all aesthetic judgments across time. Rather, we create a subject suitable for aesthetic experience together and in so doing also give birth to the aesthetic predicates that our community takes as norms. The tastes of my community are normative for me because they made my experiences possible, and my judgments are normative for our community because I am an autonomous member of that community. The sphere of the aesthetic is not universal but expanding at the speed of sound---by speaking together we create a space in which suitable subjects and ideal objects can flourish.

Our understanding of theories of art is also enhanced by looking through the lens of double negation. Artist, work, and audience must come together in a particular time and place in order to create art. Art is the concretion of a context. It is the blossoming of a historical pursuit of aesthetic excellence within a particular milieu. History is a process by which time is invested with significance through the interplay of works and styles. A milieu is enriched by the interplay of humanity and nature within a socio-ecological niche. Individual artworks are created out of the ideals of a context, which they negate, and in so negating they create a context of new ideals for new works to negate.

Finally, the hermeneutic step of destruction showed that genius as well is a process of double negation. Genius is neither the artifact of sheer individual will nor the predetermined product of nature. It is the outcome of an interplay with critics. A true genius is one who smashes up old values that have grown into mere idols and reveals the shining core of truth that comes from the flow of life itself. In doing so, the private values of the genius become public and thereby risk their own idolization. When this happens, it is time for a new genius to revive the old idols and bring new life to the values they once represented.

In *The Study of Ethics*, Watsuji writes, “The highest value is an absolute totality, and an ‘aspiration’ (an upward impulse or fervent wish) for it is ‘good’ (_zen_ [善][ja])” (WTZ 10:142). This expresses as well my attitude towards aesthetics. The highest value of aesthetics is an absolute unity. Because it is absolute, it encompasses all---the good and bad, the beautiful and ugly, the subtle and the sublime. All is unity at the cosmic level. This is, abstractly speaking, the highest value, but aesthetic good is not content to merely allow this absolute to exist abstractly. Aesthetic goodness consists of the fervent movement towards absolute unity. We leap up out of ourselves and towards the other and the object without snuffing the ordinary self out of being. We eagerly anticipate the next phase in the ceaseless movement of double negation, and we cheer it along through our conscious efforts in acting with others.

###Objections to double negation
On the whole, therefore, I believe that Watsuji's anthropology and logic of double negation has shown itself quite fruitful at explaining aesthetic phenomena. Nevertheless, there are three immediate objections to this system which I wish to address here. The first is that this system overly broad, so that it can encompass anything and everything. The second is that it is nothing but a restatement of Hegel's logic of dialectic. The third is that the system is merely speculative.

I believe the first objection may be rebutted by the fact that the system I have worked out is not contentless. Rather, there are many areas where my system objects to other popular conceptions of aesthetics. Unlike systems where the "suitable spectator" is so disinterested in the object to be disengaged, I insist that aesthetic experience is a deeper level of engagement with the object, but an engagement that takes place on the terms of the object rather than on the terms of the ordinary self. Against those systems which seek a universal basis for aesthetic normativity, I insist that aesthetic norms are rooted in the communities that gave birth to the subject and object. Unlike theories of art that try to find a singular basis for aesthetics in the artist, work, or audience, I insist that our understanding of art must take into account the context in which artist, work, and audience meet. Unlike theories of genius that try to make the genius into an individual force asserting itself against nature, I insist that the assertion of the genius is only one move in a larger double negation of public and private values between genius and critic.

The logic of double negation seems broad because it is so central to human existence. Because our lives our lived in ceaseless negation, it is natural that we can find examples of it all around us. However, double negation is not a contentless system. It insists that stasis and stoppage are death, and it resists the reification of non-substantive moments within a large movement.

The answer to that first objection should make it clear also why this system cannot be confused with mere Hegelian dialectic. Hegelian dialectic is process that evolves in a certain pre-determined pattern. Thesis and antithesis contain within them the logic of their synthesis, and the final synthesis is the ultimate goal of the absolute spirit. In Hegelian dialectic, the spirit gains greater and greater concreteness and objectivity as time goes on. Double negation has no predetermined end. While the highest value lies in totality, this does not determine the direction of its movement. Its direction is determined by the negations applied by the individuals and communities who act within it. When I as an individual in a persistent relationship assert myself as an individual, I alter the path of history. When I negate my individuality to preserve that persistent relationship, I give it a life and value that it would otherwise lack. History has no endpoint in double negation---and no guarantees that our movement will continue. It could be that the movement ceases and badness results. Still, as long as we breath, we hope; and as hopeful beings we must work diligently to allow the movement of human existence to continue.

Finally, to the charge of speculation, I cannot but plead guilty, but I dispute that my speculation is *mere* speculation. David Hume concludes his _Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding_ with the follow admonition:

> If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion.

Certainly, this dissertation contains as little abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number as I could manage, and the reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence I have engaged in has not been accompanied by actual laboratory experiments. Furthermore, the reasoning here has not been clearly separated into *a priori* and *a posteriori* arguments. Sometimes I have appealed to logic, sometimes to intuition, and sometimes to historical examples. These modes of thought have been allowed to mingle freely.

Nevertheless, I reject Hume's accusation of sophistry and illusion. I do not think that philosophy can be merely mathematical, and I do not think philosophy should be merely scientific. A metaphysical system is like a language. In the end, neither a metaphysical system nor a language is the thing it is describing (unless it is describing itself). The world is not a word, so words will always be only an approximate match for the world. If a system or language is a good one, it can be used to describe things easily and with little loss of precision, scope, and accuracy. If it is a poor one, it will lend itself to excessive prolixity, interminable confusion, and frequent misdescription. I believe that in these previous chapters, I have shown that Watsuji's anthropology and logic of double negation can be used to describe aesthetic in its fine details, with suggestive implications for the whole, and in a manner representative of the details. For this reason, while I accept that the results presented here are speculative, I do not think that is a slight of their value.

###Addressing our initial concerns
I wish to return to the initial questions offered at the outset of this inquiry. In order to clarify the popular question of "is beauty in the eye of the beholder?" seven different interpretations of the meaning of an aesthetic judgment were offered. Of those interpretations, (4) and (5) were deemed the most promising:

* (4) We might mean that any _suitable spectator_ will have an experience of beauty when experiencing this object.

* (5) We might mean that the work under discussion possesses a _capacity_ to induce experiences of beauty in suitable spectators.

In retrospect, having developed the system of aesthetics worked out here, both of these interpretations share the problem of assuming an overly stark separation between subject and object. The difference between (4) and (5) is the difference between attributing primacy of responsibility for the beauty to the subject or primacy of responsibility to the object. Causal responsibility, however, is pervasive and a matter of degrees rather than a matter of simple, singular attribution. Neither the subject nor the object is responsible alone for beauty. Rather, if attribution must be made singular, it ought to be given to the field out of which subject and object both emerge.

so then let's go back to the questoin of the eye o the beholder. the better way to say it is that the eye of the beholder is in the beauty. as i wrote before, the eye of the beholder and beauty are both dynamically co-constructed within the space of possibility by the laws of human existence. doing it that way lets us keep the two intutions that i wrote were so important, namely we feel that the aesthetic predicate is in the object enabling our discussions and we feel that our feelings give us privileged access as individuals to make judgments about that predicate. How so? Let's look at it in reverse order. how do our feelings give us privileged access?

what the subject contributes to beauty (and othr aesthetic predicates) turns crucially on the size of the subject. if you have a small subject liek the ordinary self, then you have something that is cut off from objects and cut off from others. butt the ordinary self is not the only subject. the subject is also plural and embodied. we can call this larger self the no self. no selves are great because they overcome the internal/external division. mencius says, hot drinks are internal. another way to put it is that aesthetic autonomy means that even when i'm using the taste of other peopel it is really and truly my own very personal authentic aesthetic taste and not some horrible fruedian put up job. 

so, when i say that this flower is beautiful. this isn't something that just anyone could say. it would have to be a particular person talking to a particular community. it would have to be said in a particular human language. these spheres of human relationality are the context that allow the judgment to have content. the meaning of the word beautiful comes from human beings who were talking to each other. the self/other division and combination of human beings is what makes us so awesome compared to goats or whatever. goats are out there on the beautiful mountain side, but because they don't have a fever to tell, there's no aesthetic sharing of their interiority. the subj/obj division is only ever even made possible by a prior sepration of the self/other. (in bio terms, we need a theory of mind in order to have a theory of objects.)

so, what we thought was that we needed an object to account for our aesthetic discussions being fruitful, but what it turned out to be was that we needed a subject to account for aesthetic discussions being fruitful as well. furthermore, the ability we have to cultivate our taste and become more suitable aesthetic agents (let's not call it spectators because that slights all the hard work invovled) is only possible if we have a community that have overlapping relationships and those relationships contain ideals. in that case then the suitable agent is a dude created by the community it evovles through being negated by dudes over time.

but all that said, the first intution is still really important b/c it tells us what the object contributes to stuff. the object is the concretion of a situation. it is the focus. it's the thing we need to be looking at. as i said in the theory of art section, any decent art community is gonna have hella theories about objects is going to concentrate on what makes them so great. why'z thta? because objects live inside of us and we live inside of them. without an object that is outside of the ordinary self, you can't have distance, and no distance means no aesthetic xp. no objects means there's no fullness for us to talk about when we're making our aesthetic judgments and trying to reconcile that into a taste. no object means no genius is able to create objects that carry the world inside of themselves.

###Comparison to historical approaches
ok, so to go back to what i said before about plato and kant, the trouble with both of them was that they had this all encompassing transcendent thing. for plato, it was the transcendent beauty, which pierces the lowly joe philosopher-king, and for kant is was the transcendent reason that made up the subjectivity of joe philosopher-king. i also have a penetrating thingie, but it's a) penetrating both subj and obj, and b) it's not a timeless eternal verity. the timeless part if there is one is the motion of the thing. but that's basically a description of what it is to be human and not guaranteed to survive our extinction. the ideals however are rooted in, because watsuji was totally an existentialist at heart, the lived experiences of human folks. we have ideals because our lives have an authentic aspect to them. these authentic sides are a negotiate between is and social oughts. 

- Plato's vision of the good was borderline totalitarian; he needs an individualizing moment!
- Kant got the questions right, but he needed to see that his universal reason is a logos that people make by talking to each other.
- By turning the question inside out, we were able to save our intuitions without giving up the crucial insights of our forebears.

###Future directions
  - Kant on art instruction: solve your own problems, son!
  - On hermeneutics
  - Is it too anthropomorphic?
  - Space vs. time
  - Truth vs. trust
  - A full theory of art
  - Religion, beauty and the good
  - More deconstruction
