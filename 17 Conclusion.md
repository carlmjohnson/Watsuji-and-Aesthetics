##Chapter 7. Concluding Remarks
###Unifying themes
  - Aesthetic XP
  - Aesthetic normativity
  - theories of art
  - Genius

IT'S TIME TO REVIEW WHAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED SO FAR BEFORE LEAVING IT TO READERS TO MAKE THEIR OWN JUDGMENTS. OK, LOOKING BACK, how did we do? not bad, I guess. wht was the big unifying theme of the thing? DOUNLE NEGATION, duh. Yo, check it out:

IN AE, we have a double negation between subj/pbj. First, you step away from the combined XP of everyday whatever, by distancing the S and O. Then you negate that distance to dissolve into the ecstasy of primordial unity. The experience overall is "disinterested" but not because of a Kantian lack of concern for the obj. The lack of concern, if we had to characterize it that way, is a lack of concern for the perroggatives of the ordinary self.

OK, SO WHAT ABOUT aesthetic normativity? Aesthetic judgment and aesthetic taste are two kinds of self-other in double negation. You establish a unique aesthetic judgment by negating the preceding tastes of your community, then you return to that community by creating a new taste or fashion. The basis for this process is not universal subjectivity, but a local and connected one. The tastes of my community are normative for me because they made my experiences possible, and my judgments are normative for them because I am an autonomous member of our community. The sphere of the aesthetic expands at the speed of sound.

ALRIGHTY LETS'S MOVE ON to theories of art… OK, there the double negating is pretty hot and heavy. Artist, audience, and work are all concretized as space and time. People start new art movements that negate old ones then the pendulum swings back around. All along, what's accumulated is a sense of history and milieu. What that means is we invest time and space with significance. Once time and space are so invested, they show themselves in the arts. We feed into them and then they feed us (gross?).

GENIUS as well is a negotiation not just between the world conquering genius and uncaring nature but between geniuses and critics. Together they smash up old idols and reveal shining new ideals. Private/public are non-static.

SUMMING UP, double negation is a fruitful way of looking at things. Is it too fruitful? Or is it just Hegel all over again? It's not so superopen because there are definitely somethings I'm against, like smug liberalism or Kantian disinterest. And certainly, it's Hegelish, but the difference is that the layers aren't lost in sublation (well sometimes they aren't in Hegel either… :-P). Things are always returning and reviving without be merely repeated or reiterated.

###Addressing our initial concerns
  - 7 subj/objs
  - What is "Subjective"?
    - Internal/external
  - what is a suitable spectator
  - Two intuitions
  - Eye of the beholder?

###Comparison to historical approaches
  - Criticizing Plato and Kant
  - Plato's vision of the good was borderline totalitarian; he needs an individualizing moment!
  - Kant got the questions right, but he needed to see that his universal reason is a logos that people make by talking to each other.

###Future directions
  - Kant on art instruction
  - On hermeneutics
  - Is it too anthropomorphic?
  - Space vs. time
  - Truth vs. trust
  - A full theory of art
  - Religion, beauty and the good
  - More deconstruction
