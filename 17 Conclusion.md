##Chapter 7. Concluding Remarks
###Unifying themes
  - Aesthetic XP
  - Aesthetic normativity
  - theories of art
  - Genius

To conclude, I would like to review what has been proposed so far before leaving it to reader for further judgment. Looking back, it is clear that the unifying theme of these chapters has been the application of Watsuji's anthropology of double negation to aesthetics. Aesthetics has been consistently revealed as a process of unity/division/combination (*tōitsu/bunri/ketsugō* [統一・分離・結合][ja]) understood through a hermeneutic of restoration/construction/destruction (*kangen/kōsei/hakai* [還元・構成・破壊][ja]).

In the first instance, aesthetic experience was shown to be a interplay of subject and object. In ordinary experience, we experience a fusion of subject and object as we act, but this pre-reflective fusion is not true aesthetic experience. Aesthetic experience requires that we first distance the ordinary self from the object so that we no longer see it aspectivally as a component of the self. Once this negation is in place, a further negation is possible, the negation of intoxicated dissolution. In the second negation, we leave the ordinary self in its distance from the object but take up a perspective that is larger than ordinary self---the perspective of the no-self (*muga* [無我][ja]). From this larger perspective, rather than seeing the object aspectivally "as" useful for some practical end, we see the object "as if" it had practical value---we see the object as intrinsically valuable in its own perspective. For this reason, it is appropriate to label the process of aesthetic experience as a whole "disinterested enjoyment." Disinterested enjoyment does not mean enjoyment that is aloof from things, but enjoyment that comes from inhabiting the perspective of things rather than inhabiting the perspective of the ordinary self.

Aesthetic normativity as expressed in judgment and taste was similarly shown to be the result of double negation. This double negation takes place between self and other as well as the subject and object negation of aesthetic experience. The individual develops a unique sensibility by forming aesthetic judgments that contradict the taste of the community, but the taste of the community is the matrix out of which aesthetic experiences are made possible, so these tastes hold normative significance for the individual. My judgments stem from the tastes of others and must return to them to bear fruit. Through negation together we create a space in which suitable subjects and ideal objects can evolve over time. It is not that there is a singular ideal of the "suitable spectator" that holds for all aesthetic judgments across time. Rather, we create the suitable subject together and in so doing also give birth to the aesthetic predicates that our community takes as norms.

OK, SO WHAT ABOUT aesthetic normativity? Aesthetic judgment and aesthetic taste are two kinds of self-other in double negation. You establish a unique aesthetic judgment by negating the preceding tastes of your community, then you return to that community by creating a new taste or fashion. **The basis for this process is not universal subjectivity, but a local and connected one. The tastes of my community are normative for me because they made my experiences possible, and my judgments are normative for them because I am an autonomous member of our community. The sphere of the aesthetic expands at the speed of sound.**

ALRIGHTY LETS'S MOVE ON to theories of art… OK, there the double negating is pretty hot and heavy. Artist, audience, and work are all concretized as space and time. People start new art movements that negate old ones then the pendulum swings back around. All along, what's accumulated is a sense of history and milieu. What that means is we invest time and space with significance. Once time and space are so invested, they show themselves in the arts. We feed into them and then they feed us (gross?).

GENIUS as well is a negotiation not just between the world conquering genius and uncaring nature but between geniuses and critics. Together they smash up old idols and reveal shining new ideals. Private/public are non-static.

SUMMING UP, double negation is a fruitful way of looking at things. Is it too fruitful? Or is it just Hegel all over again? It's not so superopen because there are definitely somethings I'm against, like smug liberalism or Kantian disinterest. And certainly, it's Hegelish, but the difference is that the layers aren't lost in sublation (well sometimes they aren't in Hegel either… :-P). Things are always returning and reviving without be merely repeated or reiterated.

###Addressing our initial concerns
  - 7 subj/objs
  - What is "Subjective"?
    - Internal/external
  - what is a suitable spectator
  - Two intuitions
  - Eye of the beholder?

- Interpretations 4/5 were ALL ASSUMING S/O DUALITY ANYWAY!
- The eye of the beholder is in the beauty.
- Self-other/subject-object
  - Goats don't feel beauty of the mountain, in part because they don't talk
  - The possibility of self-other is important: the subj/obj is within a self/other space (aida)
  - "Fever to tell" distinguishes the aesthetic attitude from others
- RESPOND: First, as seen, without any common object shared by different participants in a discussion, it is not possible for any mutual discussion of aesthetics to take place. This is contradicted by our experience, in which aesthetics *is* fruitfully discussed, at least some of the time. Second, in the limit, there will be no ability for one to cultivate one’s aesthetic judgment, since there will be nothing outside of a momentary, subjective experience to appeal to in the cultivation of one’s taste
- The sphere of aesthetic discussion expands at the speed of sound: discussing aesthetics makes discussion of aesthetics possible. 

###Comparison to historical approaches
  - Criticizing Plato and Kant
  - Plato's vision of the good was borderline totalitarian; he needs an individualizing moment!
  - Kant got the questions right, but he needed to see that his universal reason is a logos that people make by talking to each other.

###Future directions
  - Kant on art instruction
  - On hermeneutics
  - Is it too anthropomorphic?
  - Space vs. time
  - Truth vs. trust
  - A full theory of art
  - Religion, beauty and the good
  - More deconstruction
