###Crisis of East and West
PROBLEM:
-	Tea ceremony: shows the aesthetic as action, not observation. Flower arranging: show the aesthetic as contextual, not universal (flowers are for the occasion).
HOW CAN THESE "ARTS" BE AESTHETIC IF AESTHETICS IS ALL DETACHED AND WHATNOT?
-	Western paintings are appreciated by looking at the image and considering what is an image of or how the image looks. Eastern paintings are appreciated by imagining painting it yourself.
