##Abstract
A central question in aesthetics is whether aesthetic judgment is subjective or objective. Existing approaches to answering this question have been unsatisfying because they begin with the assumption of an individual observer that must then be communalized through the introduction of a transcendent object or the transcendental reason of the subject. Rather than introduce a vertical transcendence to account for the ideal observer, I propose an alternative account based on the anthropology of the Japanese philosopher [Watsuji][sc] Tetsurō. According to Watsuji, human existence is a movement of double negation whereby we negate our emptiness in order to individuate ourselves and we negate our individuality in order to form communal wholes. Human beings are empty of independent existence, and thus open to create ideal aesthetic subjects in historically and regionally situated communal contexts.

I propose an account of aesthetic experience as a double negation in which we negate our surroundings in order to create a sense of psychical distance and negate our ordinary selves in order to dissolve into the background of primordial unity. I examine aesthetic normativity and find that the subject of aesthetics is active and plural rather than passive and individual. Aesthetic judgment and taste are, respectively, individual and communal moments in the process of double negation. Artistic evolution is a process by which the context of artist, artwork, and audience develop into a meaningful historical milieu. Genius is the ability to make public one's private values through the creation of objects that can travel beyond their original contexts and create new contexts around them. Such an ability is the result of a double negation played out between the genius and critical receptivity.

Extended examples taken from Noh theater, Japanese linked verse, tea ceremony, and *The Tale of Genji* are also used to illustrate my arguments.

##Chapter 1. The Problem of Aesthetic Subjectivity
* Is “beauty in the eye of the beholder”?

* Two intuitions: **the aesthetic predicate is *in* the object enabling our discussions** and **our feelings give *us* privileged access as individuals to make judgments about that predicate**.

* Two interpretations of aesthetic judgments: **the work under discussion possesses a capacity to induce experiences of beauty in suitable spectators** (Plato) and **any *suitable spectator* will have an experience of beauty when experiencing this object** (Kant).

##Chapter 2. Anthropology and Methodology
* **Human beings** (*ningen* 人間) are both individual and social. We exist in **persistent relationships** (*aidagara* 間柄) as the **double negation** of **emptiness** (*kū* 空).

* “Human existence itself is a movement that realizes its authentic unity in the linkage of **unity/division/combination** (_tōitsu/bunri/ketsugō_ [統一・分離・結合][ja])” (WTZ 10:40), which we understand through “the hermeneutic method of **restoration/construction/destruction** (_kangen/kōsei/hakai_ [還元・構成・破壊][ja])” (WTZ 10:49).

##Chapter 3. Aesthetic Experience as Distancing, Dissolution, and Disinterest
* Ordinary experience is **instrumental** and **aspectival**. It oscillates between the mode of combination (ready-to-hand) and division (present-at-hand).

* Aesthetic experience is a form of **disinterested enjoyment** resulting from **psychic distancing** and **intoxicated dissolution**. It moves back from the division of subject and object to the primordial unity of experience.

##Chapter 4. The Subject and Object in Aesthetic Normativity
* The **subject** is active and plural (*shutai* 主体, not *shukan* 主観).

* The **object** is impermanent but insistent.

* **Aesthetic judgment** can be subjective but normative.

* **Aesthetic taste** can be communal but authentic.

##Chapter 5. Art, History, and Milieu
* **Theories of art** may be artist-centric, work-centric, audience-centric, context-centric, or some combination thereof.

* **History** is a process of double negation that creates multiple layers (*jūsōsei* 重層性) of temporal significance.

* **Milieu** is the significance of space for human existence. The three key milieux Watsuji described are monsoon, desert, and meadow.

##Chapter 6. Beyond the Bounds of Aesthetics: Criticism, Genius, and Culture
* **Critics** must employ “love” or “empathy” to prepare the communal stage for genius.

* **Genius** is an individualized expression of creativity that allows an object to move beyond its original context and into new ones.

* **Public** and **private** values must not become hardened into fixed patterns of **idolatry** or **iconoclasm**. Rather, values must continually interchange in order to keep **culture** living and vital.

##Chapter 7. Concluding Remarks
* In traditional approaches, either the ideal aesthetic observer is in contact with a **transcendent form** that grounds judgment from the object side, or the suitable spectator possesses **transcendental reason** that grounds judgment on the subject side.

* **The eye of the beholder is in the beauty**. That is to say, the eye of the beholder and beauty are dynamic co-constructions within the space of possibility created by the laws of human existence. Aesthetics is both subjective and objective because aesthetics rests on the particular way that the subject is able to inhabit objects.

##Illustrations from Japanese art
* **Noh theater**: _Ri-ken no ken_ 離見の見 ("the seeing of distant-seeing") and *yūgen* 幽玄 ("mysterious profundity").

* **Linked verse**: *Ki ai* 気合い ("the coming together of vital energy") and *hon'i* 本意 ("the root implications").

* **Tea ceremony**: *Ichigo-ichie* 一期一会 ("a unique time, a unique meeting") and _wa kei sei jaku_ [和敬清寂][ja] ("harmony, respect, purity, and tranquility").

* **The Tale of Genji**: *Mujōkan* 無常感 ("feeling of impermanence") and *mono no aware* もののあはれ ("the pathos of things").
