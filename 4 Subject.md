##Chapter 4. Reconstructing the Subject of Aesthetic Judgment
Having investigated the meeting point of feeling in aesthetic experience, we must now attempt to reconstruct this subject who comes to feel compelled by the aesthetic experience of others. How do I form my aesthetic judgments as an individual, and how could I ever share my personal, internal, individual aesthetic judgments with any else? Why should I as an individual come to feel compelled in my aesthetic preferences by the preferences of others? What is the source aesthetic agreement? How is it that there are such things as communities of taste? How can deference to such preferences of others possibly authentically express my subjectivity? Is there anything like normativity in aesthetic judgment or can we only describe our aesthetic feelings without prescribing them?

As Watsuji notes in his _Study of Ethics_, 

> The discrimination between approval and disapproval is itself both individual and social and thus cannot be comprehended without recourse to the fundamental structure of a human being. (127–8)

Therefore, to answer these questions about normativity in aesthetic judgment, we must first to see how the subjectivity normativity arises in matters of ethics, so as to better grasp the fundamental structures of the human being. In so doing, we lay the groundwork for an expanded notion of the subject, in which what is outside of my body can nevertheless be an expression of my subjectivity and aesthetic judgment can be communal judgment yet also a subjective judgment.

###What is the source of normativity for aesthetic judgment?
As Watsuji explains in _Study of Ethics_ though there is regional variation in morality---for example, one society may approve of human sacrifice while another condemns it---this does not undermine the universality of the basis of ethics. In all societies what is condemned are actions that undermine the trust basis of that society and what is praised are actions that reinforce the trust basis of that society. But if this is the case, how is it that we as individual members of society feel the call of conscience? If these values are being imposed on us from without in order to preserve society, then it is not clear why as individuals we should feel an *inner* impulse towards a morality made to preserve *outer* order. In that case, moral education is a kind of deformation of the person by which the individual is trained to ignore her authentic desires and interests and produce within herself a feeling of subordination to the order outside of her. Could it be that our call of conscience really be the result of a super-ego that is essential alien to us? Watsuji argues no. In the determination of guilt by a court of law, the one who accuses me stands in for society as whole, but in an affliction of conscience, the one who accuses me is the very emptiness at the heart of my self. In spite of the great degree of social determination that undoubtably goes into the formation of conscience, when we truly feel the call of conscience it does not feel to us as something coming from without but it feels as though it was coming from our inmost personality. 

The reason for this should already be somewhat clear from our prior discussion of Watsuji’s anthropology. When we understand the subject correctly, we see it as arising out of the negation of the emptiness that stands prior to the individual or the community. As such, the call of conscience does not arise as an external voice speaking for society but as an internal voice speaking for the authentic source of the subject. As Watsuji writes, “an established betweenness is […] authenticity as a the ground out of which we, fundamentally speaking, come forth” (187). Again, Watsuji is fundamentally an existentialist in his ethics, since he sees expressing the individual authentically as the source of ethical normativity, but where Watsuji differs from other existentialists is that he is clear that authenticity comes from a return to the source of our being according to the fundamental law of human existence and that source is our persistent relationships.

Watsuji explicitly links his discussion of conscience to Mencius<!--§-->, who coined the term [良心][ch], which evolved eventually into the term _ryōshin_ in Japanese and _liangxin_ in Modern Standard Mandarin and is used to translate the English word “conscience.” In the Warring States period, there was a debate about whether moral appropriateness ([義][ch] _yi_) was _nei_ [内][ch] (roughly speaking, “internal”) or _wai_ [外][ch] (“external”). There have been various interpretations of the exact meaning of this debate, but we may on a loose reading take it that they wanted to know whether morality is in some ways dependent on the dispositions of the individual or if moral normativity can be imposed on the individual from without by completely impersonal formal considerations. For his part, Mencius claims that our sense of the appropriate must be _nei_ even as it responds to conditions in the world. I argue that what Mencius means by this is not that morality is ‘subjective’ in the sense of being determined only by the individual, but that morality is _nei_ in the sense that it originates in our most inner and authentic self even as it is importantly interpenetrated by our relationships with others. Mencius and his interlocutors agree that one can take  gustatory taste---savoring a roast or wanting a drink of water---as paradigmatic example of _nei_ (_Mencius_ 6A.4 and 6A.5). Mencius points out that these tastes, while paradigmatically internal, are nevertheless respondent to external conditions. On a hot day, I would like a cold drink, but on a cold day, I would like a hot drink. My wanting a particular kind of drink on the basis of these external circumstances cannot be the result of some coercive education in inauthenticity. If these sorts of desires are not authentic, then there are no authentic desires. In the same way, argues Mencius, our sense of what is appropriate must respond to external circumstances (and should it fail to respond it would be an error, just as it is an error to desire salt water in a desert), but it nevertheless the internality of the sense of appropriateness which gives it jurisdiction with which to compel us. 

In Watsuji’s language, we may state this same idea somewhat differently. Legitimate compulsion of the individual can only arise from the source of the individual, that is, from the subject, but the subjective origin of this compulsion does not mean that it is only a matter of what one particular person feels. The subject is not only individual. In our everyday experience, it is possible for social structures seemingly outside of the individual such as the family, community, or state to compel the individual, but this does not mean that they can exercise their authority insofar as they are external. They have authority only insofar as they are constitutive of one as a person. As he explains, 

> A family or a state, as instances of socio-ethical wholes, has the authority to demand obedience from individuals, but this demand cannot be authorized merely from the standpoint of a family or a state. (125)

If it is not as socio-ethical wholes that these institutions speak authoritatively, on whose behalf are they speaking? Socio-ethical wholes have the authority to compel just to the degree that they speak for the betweenness out which both they and the individual arise. Because the source of the individual and the social whole is the same, the one is on occasion able to speak for the other as the voice of its autonomous subject. This means both that the state is able to compel the citizen to follow its (just) laws and that the citizen is able compel the state to reform its unjust laws. The basis for both forms of compulsion is the mutual dependance of the two: the individual could not be who she is without her state, and the state could not exist without its individuals. At its best, the relationship of the citizen and the state is one of virtuosic mutual contribution. 

We may apply this understanding of the internality of conscience and morality to the normativity of aesthetic judgment by analogy to fashion: if the fashion choices we make are imposed on us from outside---and they certainly are, otherwise it would not just so happen that men in the West wear shirts and pants, whereas men in other cultures have worn robes, etc., etc.---then why do we feel as though when I dress I put on clothes that reflect _my_ taste in clothing? Has the outside force of fashion education deformed my authentic sartorial feelings? Watsuji argues to the contrary that fashion is an everyday experience of a kind of communal consciousness:

> What makes this communal consciousness manifest in a particularly 
> bold form, is the phenomenon of "fashion." Fashion makes its 
> appearance within the modes of clothing, food, and housing already 
> historically and nationally fixed as more detailed common 
> favorites. Even though individuals did not, to begin with, become 
> conscious of a common favorite as their own, nevertheless, they do 
> feel it to be their own favorite to the extent that they are inclined to 
> view deviations from this favorite as either something funny or 
> ugly. (74–5)

In other words, in fashion our aesthetic norms originate outside of the particular individual, but they are nevertheless felt as the subjective tastes of individuals because those individuals are ultimately expressions through negation of the prior betweenness. Society may help shape my taste in fashion, but it is still _my_ taste. At the same time, however, by changing my taste in fashion, it is possible for me to change society’s taste in fashion. The two forms of taste are mutually entailing and are ultimately expressions of the ways in which I as individual am made in part by the fashion of my society and my society is made in part by me.

Like Mencius, Watsuji also argues that we can see this same responsiveness of the internal to outside conditions in the physical sense of taste. He writes,

> [W]e taste food by dividing it among us. Its taste depends on each person's peculiar sense of taste. In spite of this, is it true to say that tastes differ from one to another? Do we not enjoy the same sweetness when we taste sugar, dividing it among us? If one person tastes sugar and finds it bitter, we would lose no time in finding her a medical care on the assumption that she is sick. We attempt to deal with her as a person who is normally able to taste the same sweetness, although she is temporarily deprived of this ability. Based on the phenomenon that people experience the same taste, "communal eating," has played an important role since ancient times. […] If it were true that bodily feelings separate people from one another, then such instances could not have occurred. (75–6)

For Watsuji, even highly subjective phenomena like our gustatory desires arise out of a wider matrix:

> Human desires are already characterized by specific social forms. For instance, an appetite makes its appearance as a desire for bread, rice, a meat dish, or seafood specifically, all instances peculiar to the cultural location where the appetite arises. That there are fixed forms of cooking is already proof that the appetite is the appetite of the community, rather than being strictly individual. (74)

When we apply this to aesthetics more broadly, we see that aesthetic judgment always takes place within a social and ethical context. In the aesthetic experience of tasting delicious food, for instance, one nearly loses oneself in rapture to the flavorful sensation of the dish. However, this experience of partial self-dissolution is always made possible first by specific cultural structures. Before we can experience a meeting of subject-object, there must be a coming together of individuals as a collective subject in a society. Hence our understanding of the subject of aesthetic experience can never be limited to an appreciation for the individual’s experience alone, but we must also appreciate the ways in which the communal whole enjoys the aesthetic experience as a subject. Hence there is a voice which is able to speak with authority about the kinds of taste experiences we “should” be having when we enter into an aesthetic experience. It is the voice of the society as it expresses itself as the source of the individual. Because this voice is trans-personal, it is possible for us as members of a community to discuss our tastes productively. It is not entirely “subjective” in the sense of being entirely individual-relative. On the other hand, since the voice is also the voice of the inmost source of the individual, this voice is “subjective” in the sense of being a part of the subject and able to, at times, command the assent of the subject.

###Crisis of East and West
What brings particular focus to the problem of normativity in aesthetic judgment is a little mentioned crisis in Eastern Aesthetics. The art forms valorized in pre-modern Japan only partially overlapped with those art forms valorized in the West. To the Edo period aesthete, Ukiyo-e and kabuki were hopelessly vulgar; landscape paintings and nature paintings were clearly superior to historical paintings; achieving linear perspective was an error, not a goal; statuary was almost exclusively religious; poetry was an invariably social pursuit means of bringing meaning to life; the highest forms of art were tea ceremony and flower arranging. Needless to say, these values were nearly completely overturned by the West. In France, artists under the spell of *Japonisme* (notably, van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec) were strongly influenced by ukiyo-e rather than "higher" forms of visual art. Too much has been written about the shift to linear perspective in the Renaissance and its greater implications for a shift in patterns of thought to attempt a recap here. Similarly, Western statuary had been transformed from religious to secular during the Renaissance as a byproduct of the iconoclasm of earlier eras. Western poetry is ideally written by brooding, lonely geniuses. Tea ceremony and flower arranging have never achieved more than marginal acceptance in the West. Accordingly, a crisis of self-confidence in the arts in Japan was only natural. The sole exception to this pattern is the supposed superiority of landscape and nature painting. However, this is only so because Japanese art arrived in the West at a fortuitous time to accelerate the shift away from historic and occasional paintings to landscapes, still life, and eventually abstract art through the embrace of ukiyo-e in *Japonisme*.

If any lesson is to be gleaned from this cultural clash, it must be the volatility of our aesthetic judgments within the vicissitudes of historical evolutions in art theory. A theory of shared aesthetic judgment cannot be complete without comment on the relationship between particular judgments and the world of art as a whole. Accordingly if we are to truly understand the mechanics of aesthetic judgment, we must undertake a lengthy digression here to consider just some of the possible theories of art and how they fit within the scheme of aesthetic experience as distance and ecstasy described in the last chapter.

###Consideration of Possible Theories of Art
To bring order to what might be a nearly endless task, I will begin by classifying theories of art according to which cause from Aristotle’s theory of four causes the theory takes to be primary in creating art: efficient, formal, material, or final. Efficient theories are those that focus their explanations on the processes that give rise to art rather than art objects themselves; formal theories try to characterize what different art objects have in common; material theories look at the art object itself; and final theories are those that focus on the purpose of art or lack thereof. Once I have looked at art theories according to these classifications, I will utilize the additional category of the “place” of art to better characterize remaining possible theories. Finally, I will conclude by noting the inadequacy of any theory with just a single focus to capture all of our intuitions about art and recommend that instead we create a robust theory that incorporates elements of each potential causal foci into a larger normative vision for the world as a whole.

####Efficient Cause
It has often been noticed that out of Aristotle’s four causes, efficient causation is all that is meant today when we speak of “causation” in general. David Hume is notorious in this regard for introducing the image of the colliding billiard ball as the paradigm of a causal interaction. Within theories of art, the theories that we may classify as focusing on efficient causation are those that focus on explaining _how_ art is made rather than focusing on describing art objects. For these theories what is determinative of an object’s status as a work of art is the process by which it has come to be. 

For example, an efficient theory of art may emphasize that works of art are created as matter of painstaking attention by the artist. On this basis, purported artworks which are created in a slapdash manner may be eliminated from consideration as possible art objects. This leads to the common objection to certain purported artworks that “my child could have done that.” In other words, the degree to which an object is artistic is related in certain ways to the level of skill necessary to create the object.

On the other hand, some theories of art focus on the importance of “spontaneity” over mere skill. Such theories describe skill as a quality of the craftsman rather than the artist proper. Related theories of art hold that it is the process of “expression” that makes an act an artistic act. On this set of theories, an artwork is the result of a process by which an artist expresses him- or herself through the art. This set of theories eliminates banal but meticulously crafted objects from consideration as art objects on the grounds that such purported artworks fail to express any aspect of the inner life of the artist. Similarly, overtly commercial objects are viewed with suspicion.

A focus on how an artwork comes to be leads naturally to a consideration of who it is that creates the artwork (the subjective turn). One seemingly tautologous way of speaking about art is to say that “Art is what artists make.” From that logical starting point, one might suppose that the qualities of the artist are what make some objects works of art and others not. Although logically speaking one might just as easily suppose the reverse---that is the properties of the art that makes the artist---nevertheless, this is a way of thinking about art with broad popular reception that is reinforced through stereotypes like the starving artist or tortured genius. Hence another set of art theories focus on the artist as the locus of art. These theories combine well with the earlier two theories by supposing that an artist is a person with great skill who desires to express him- or herself spontaneously in art and avoids commercial entanglements.

The apotheosis of the efficient cause theory of art must be the famous urinal of Marcel Duchamp (or “R. Mutt”). The object itself, like his other readymades, has no claim to being art except that it was produced by Duchamp who, as an artist, is qualified to turn ordinary objects into artworks merely by deeming them artworks. For Duchamp, the primordial artistic act is submitting an object to a gallery for inclusion. (The role of the gallery will be explored in greater depth in the section on “place.”) The theory underlying Duchamp’s practice has been the subject of much discussion but whatever it is, we can say that in general it holds that there are very few properties that an individual is required to possess in order to qualify as an artist. In fact, it might be that to be an artist one needs only to declare oneself to be an artist. Or perhaps the artist is an individual recognized as such by other artists. (The “Artworld” theory will also be explored in greater depth later.)

One common flaw for theories of art that focus on the efficient cause as a defining aspect is that the processes involved in the creation of art have many side-effects which do not count as artworks inventions. It may be that the artist creates an artwork through sweat and tears, but the sweat and tears are not themselves artworks. Neither is a great artist creating art when in the restroom. In order to distinguish things that the artist makes which are art from those that are not, we must look at the artwork. When we look at the object, what we will see first are its formal qualities.

####Formal Cause
Theories of art that look at the formal characteristics of the work have a long and venerable tradition. They tend to be at their height when there is a strong tradition of criticism within a culture. Around the world, whenever a field of art becomes sufficiently mature, artists and critics will begin creating elaborate theories to explain just what qualities a superior work has to separate it from an inferior work. For this reason, there are innumerable different and frequently conflicting formal theories of art.

For example, many of the mid-twentieth century art movements in America were centered around the theory that a good painting is a painting in which certain formal qualities were balanced in a particular way. For this reason, the critic Clement Greenberg praised the work of Jackson Pollock, since it invited the viewer to *just look* at the canvas without interpolating any interpretations of the meaning of the work. The formal qualities of the work were felt to stand or fall on their own merits apart from the life of the painter or the meaning of the work. In a more surrealist vein, René Magritte’s *[La trahison des images][fr]* confronts us with the fact that we are looking at a painting of a pipe and a pipe itself, thus inviting us to consider it as a formal arrangement of pigments on canvas. 

In spite of the narrow meaning of “formalism” within art theory, we might also classify theories of art that focus on shared properties and patterns common to superior works of art as formal cause theories. Thus, theories about the proper contents for artworks are “formal” theories in this broader sense of “formal.” For example, it was a widely held opinion in French salons early in the nineteenth century that paintings or sculptures which deal with mythological or historical events are more artistically valuable than those that deal with still life or landscapes, but over the course of the century, this opinion was reversed. By the mid-twentieth century, it was widely felt by elite critics that the best content for a painting was no content; abstract painting was considered superior to representational painting. This shifting of opinions can be seen as a historical process in which new formal theories replace old ones. Whatever particular kind of content it is that critics favor at a given time, the fact they are classifying things as more or less artistic according to the similarity of the works to some ideal means that all of these theories are focused on the formal causation of the work.

Whichever specific formal theory one favors, it is clear that existence of such a vast range of theories casts doubt on the viability any particular one. Such theories are transparently subject to the passing whims of history and clearly enshrine the tastes of their creators. When painters paint colorful canvases, the critics praise vividness; when painters paint subdued canvases, the critics praise restraint. Each theory has too specific of a vision of what a proper form is to be very lasting. At the same time, as we shall see, these theories fall short by neglecting the particularity of the object. To make a more particular theory, we must focus on the material cause, and to make a more general theory, we must focus on the final cause.

####Material Cause
Perhaps the simplest theory of art is to hold that what makes a thing art is the material from which the work is made. Paint on canvas is a painting, and therefore art. Marble when hewn makes sculptures. Paper when marked is a drawing.

Unfortunately, well recognized forms of art have no particular material associated with them. For example, theater can be reasonably well accommodated by an efficient theory or a formal theory, but there is no clear material by which it can be incorporated into a “material” theory of art for this sense of the word material.

Furthermore, although these theories focus on the kinds of materials needed for art,  these “material” theories are actually “formal” theories in disguise, in that they focus on the form that the materials ought to take rather than the material itself. Unless a theory is focused on what the materials are in themselves, it cannot be called a truly material theory.

Once all outward aspects of the object are taken away, what is left for a truly material theory of art to focus on? One answer might be the way that art objects are often invested with a kind of “aura” or historicity that cannot be captured formally or efficiently. For example, a perfect copy of a Van Gogh painting that is formally identical to the original would not have the same economic value as an original Van Gogh. Furthermore, many art theorists will insist that it also properly lacks the same artistic value as the original. There is something about the material of the original art object that gets invested with a value that no copy can ever possess, no matter how exactly it duplicates the outer form of the original.

One might try to explain this value in terms of the efficient cause of the work. It might be suggested that the difference between the two lies in the fact that the original was created in an act of expression, whereas the copy was created for merely base commercial reasons. However, such a theory will be unable to explain why another person who happened to have the same character and experiences as Van Gogh would not be able to spontaneously create paintings of identical artistic value.[^] Even an identical process of efficient causation cannot give a new art object the same underlying materiality as a prior work.

[^]: For a humorous example of an author attempting to replicate the form of a work without replicating its efficient cause, see J. L. Borges’ short story “Pierre Menard, Author of the _Quixote_” (available at `http://www.coldbacon.com/writing/borges-quixote.html` as of Spring 2010).

A purely material theory of art is impossible, because it would not be a theory at all, just an assertion that some things are art. It would be an ontology that asserts the existence of art beings without giving an epistemology of art images. However a hybrid theory with a strong emphasis on the material aspect of art could be made that would focus on the haecceity of a work or event. Each work has a particularity all its own, which no other work possesses. Certain objects have a kind of artistic sacredness because of their historicity. Even non-material arts can claim such haecceity, as seen in the Japanese tea master Sen no Rikyū’s concept of _ichi-go ichi-e_ 一期一会 or “one time, one meeting.” According to Sen no Rikyū, each particular performance of the tea ceremony has a specificity that will never arise again and must be appreciated in and for itself alone. Material cause focused theories of art would hold that art has an attentiveness to the suchness of experience.

Theories relating art and technology to the material underlying objects are interesting, but as mentioned, there cannot be complete theories of art and technology which focus solely on the material. The Zen aesthetics of medieval Japan is the theory of art that comes closest to a purely material theory of art that I am aware of, yet even there an appreciation for the circumstances which allow awareness of the suchness of things must be addressed by the theory. Any material theory of art inevitably gains its generality by speaking about the purpose of art as being awareness of materiality, but of course “purpose” is another name for Aristotle’s final causation. (In the case of Zen aesthetics, we may speak of the soteriological dimension of _satori_.) Accordingly, we are drawn into a consideration of alternative theories of the purposes of art aside from merely bringing our attention to material itself.

####Final Cause
The purpose of art is a topic that has been debated as extensively as the topic of what art is. Indeed, there is widespread disagreement about whether art can or should have a purpose or not. Nevertheless, I will take as final theories of art any theory of art which defines in art in relation to its purpose or lack thereof. 

One common theory of the purpose of art is that art is for moral instruction. In the strong form of this theory, all art is didactic; it is only that sometimes the artists do not know how their art is instructing others. In a weaker form, good art is art that allows for the proper instruction of others, neutral art is that which has no effect, and bad art is that which leads to corruption. Although this family of theories may seem quite vulgar to aesthetes, it finds backing from such well-respected sources as Leo Tolstoy and Plato. Tolstoy in _What is Art?_ explains that the activity of art is based on the “capacity of man to receive another man's expression of feeling and experience those feelings himself” (5.5) and that as a result “The stronger the infection [of feeling and experience in the audience], the better is the art as art” (15.29).[^] Plato in the early books of the _Republic_ has Socrates discuss music and poetry solely as it relates to the education of the auxiliaries and guardians and seems to take this as their purpose.

[^]: Tolstoy, Leo. _What is Art?_. Tr. Alymer Maude. Available online at `http://www.csulb.edu/~jvancamp/361r14.html` as Spring 2010.

One possible alternative purpose for art can be seen in the tenth book of the _Republic_ when poetry is banned for its overly broad mimesis of things the poet does not know. Many in the public seem to take mimesis of visual experience to be the defining quality of visual art, and they seem positively offended by the nineteenth and twentieth century trends away from mimesis and towards expression and abstraction. Although mimesis is somewhat mystifying as a purpose for art (why should I want a perfect visual copy of a table rather than a real table that I can use?), it cannot be denied that art is often utilized for its mimetic abilities and ranked according to its fidelity of mimesis.

Similar to theories of simple mimesis are theories of refined mimesis and theories of catharsis. In these theories, the purpose of art is not simply to double the world like a mirror but to bring out its most salient aspects for their contemplation by an audience. The audience is, as in didactic art, brought to greater understanding of life and their place in the world by engaging with art that takes the chaos of raw experience and transforms it into something aesthetically appreciable. Or if this is not the effect on the audience, then at the very least art can serve as a kind of therapy for the artist and help the artist to express something that otherwise could not be expressed in words and so would trouble him or her deeply.

Related theories that focus on the artist’s relationship to his or her audience concentrate on the purported difference between a mere craftsman and a true artist or genius. A craftsman is able to realize objects that fulfill a certain formal vision for what beautiful objects ought to be, but a true genius is able to create new formal visions for what beauty is through their production of new objects. The purpose of real art, on this view, is to bring new concepts into our consideration, so that we may have a richer experience of and appreciation for the world around us.

Other theories about the purpose of art place less emphasis on the fact that art allows for the aesthetic re-appreciation of the world than the aesthetic experience itself. These theories are closely connected to theories of “art for art’s sake.” Aesthetic experience is taken to be different from a mere pleasure but nevertheless good for its own sake without any need for further instrumental value. (A distinction between aesthetic experience and mere pleasure must be made so that one can have an aesthetic experience “disinterestedly,” that is, without concern for how the objects of such experience may be utilized instrumentally for obtaining pleasure.)<!--§--> The appreciation for the world gained by aesthetic experience may or may not lead to any difference in one’s behavior or activity in the world, but the experience itself is nevertheless of value. Art objects, for these theories, are any objects which assist in the inducing of aesthetic experiences.

One difficulty for theories of aesthetic experience is that two observers may have different experiences when faced with the same object or situation. Theories about the “ideal observer” attempt to circumvent this shortcoming by describing what sort of observer is best positioned to have the right kind of aesthetic experience. Such theories can be further combined with earlier theories of didactic art by postulating that the enculturation of the individual so as to be able to have a certain kind of aesthetic experience is best spurred on by prior exposure to other art objects in a certain progression in a manner similar to moral education. Theories of the ideal observer can be further combined with larger moral, political, or religious ideals in order to describe the sort of individual who, it is hoped, will be the product of a proper aesthetic education. Thus, even though both theories of the ideal observer and theories of art for art’s sake emphasize the importance of aesthetic experience, these two categories of theories may be strongly opposed to one another, since ideal observer theories describe the creation of ideal observers as the purpose for which art exists.

Religious theories of art can be quite similar to ideal observer theories in that both emphasize the importance of creating a certain kind of individual, but religious theories differ in that they see this activity as not just normatively preferable but a means of communing with the gods themselves. Worth noting is that these religious theories of art may be more ancient than any of the other aforementioned theories, in that we see a close connection between religion and the various arts in many non-modern cultures around the world. Even canonical examples of art such as the Venus de Milo or the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel were original created in a religious context as objects not only of beauty but also of religious veneration.<!--revival of idols?§--> Religious theories of art sometimes claim that it is an act of piety to create religious art on behalf of the gods, and as such artistic creation can earn one various forms of merit or favor. Religions also have a tendency to strictly regulate the kinds of religious art that are appropriate. In their strictest forms, religions may have a literally iconoclastic attitude towards any representational art whatsoever. Even in less strict forms, religions may precisely regulate the formal qualities that they feel are appropriate for art.

As shown above, a wide variety of purposes have been proposed as the key aspect of art, including no purpose. To truly choose from among this panoply of possible final causes of art would require an investigation of the good for human nature which goes beyond the scope of this work. However, there is another possible angle from which we can examine potential theories of art. Going beyond Aristotle’s four causes, we will examine the role of “place” in causation.

####Place as Cause
Aristotle’s four causes were created to classify the various factors which must converge in order for a substance to come into being and remain in existence. Speaking in terms of journalism’s Five Ws and One H, they cover Who creates the thing and How they do so (efficient causation), What kinds of things are created (formal causation), What they are created out of (material causation), and Why they are created (final causation). What the four causes leave out are Where spatially and When historically things come into being. For Watsuji, the where of creation is climate and the when of creation is history. These will be examined in greater depth in chapter 5.<!--§--> For now, I will term the where-and-when of a work of art its "place" on analogy to Aristotle's _topos_, Nishida's _basho_ [場所] [ja], or Watsuji's _aidagara_. The place of a thing is as much of a requirement as any other cause, since an object or process which lacks a place in space and time cannot be said exist in the conventional sense. Having a place imparts a relational dimension to an object that lets us ask about its surroundings as well as its direct causes. In a non-reductive view of an artwork, its context will be inseparable from the more central content into which we are inquiring. By understanding the "place" of a thing, we come to understand the sort of context that gives rise to it.

Returning to the topic of the religious origin of art, one can say that the original “place” of the Venus de Milo was a temple, but through the twists of history, the statue lost that original place and ended up in the gallery of the Louvre.<!--§Ditto revival--> On the other hand, the original place of Duchamp’s urinal was, of course, the restroom. Nevertheless, having been selected by the artist, its new place is also the gallery. The gallery is a place that inherits the social role of the temple in the same way that secular theater inherits the role of the religious rite. In these cases, what was originally a *divine* ecstasy is secularized into a communal aesthetic experience. As mentioned in the section on material causation, art objects have a kind of “aura” of originality. A theory of art as the inheritor of the place of civil religion will point out that cult objects are also thought to have a literal aura in virtue of their position in a sacred place.[^] Artists on this theory are kind of literal priesthood who have the ability to transubstantiate things from being vulgar objects to being art objects merely by introducing them to the gallery space in the proper way. Once so installed, ordinary people will make pilgrimages from great distances in order to have their lives improved by contact (usually only visual contact) with the set-apart objects.

[^]: Cf. Matthew 23:17, in which Jesus rhetorically asks, “for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that hath sanctified the gold?” It is clear that Jesus sees the sacredness of the temple as a place lending sacredness to the contents of the temple.

The theory that the gallery historically inherits the place of the temple accounts for many of the more romantic or grandiose sentiments that are attached to art, but it fails to account for who the artists and art critics are and what activity unites them. If they are a priesthood of some sort, they must have set of dogmas and rituals that give them common purpose and make them one priesthood and not another. One widely received theory of art in the twentieth century is Arthur Danto’s “Artworld” theory. On this theory, artists select works (some commenters use the term “baptize”) and submit them to relevant individuals in the Artworld for consideration. If they approve of an object, then it becomes art. If they do not, it remains what it is. The topic of conversation that sets the Artworld apart from other groups of human beings is “aesthetic predicates.” The Artworld considers the aesthetic experience of the object that is possible when certain formal properties (in the broad sense of formal) are taken into account and progresses by developing new and more interesting predicates as time goes on. Understanding an art object means understanding the aesthetic experience the object would provoke in its intended Artworld and in the Artworld as it stands today. When the object’s place in the Artworld is grasped, the object is known.[^]

[^]: The process of properly understanding an art object for Danto is similar to the process of objectively understanding a physical object for Kant with the Artworld taking the place of transcendental Reason. For Kant, an understanding is objective if it accords with the understanding that would be produced by a being that possesses Reason. For Danto, an understanding of art is proper if it accords with the understanding that would be produced by a member of the Artworld. Also like Kant, Danto sees the great artist as a kind of genius who increases our store of concepts (“predicates”) by which we can recognize beauty (“aesthetic experiences”). 

####Confluence of causes
Aristotle’s four causes have been used a mere heuristic to bring order to this investigation, but if we return briefly to their original conception, we see that Aristotle claims it is only with the confluence of all the causes that a substance can come to be. In the same way, a robust theory of art or technology will need to be multifaceted in order to take into account the role of all five causal factors. No one perspective is enough to capture everything we think about art and technology. 

It is a philosopher’s delusion to think that behind our jumbled ordinary intuitions there must stand a single unified and determinative definition for the concept in question. As such, so long as we are exploring the space of possible concepts permitted by our intuitions, we will never find the unifying factor that lies behind the concept. Rather than “finding” this unifying factor, the philosopher must _create_ it by looking at what exactly it is what use the concept to do and what we ought to be using the concept to do. As Plato analogizes in Book VI of the _Republic_, it is only in the light of the Good that we see the essence of things. In Watsuji's terms, without focusing first on the practical good of something in human existence, we will not understand its existence (*sonzai*).<!--have I explained sonzai yet?§-->

Looking at how various theories of art are used, it is clear that the definition of art is at its most contested when the matter of prestige is on the line. Sometimes a discipline will claim the mantle of “art” in order to raise its prestige, and other times prestige is increased by rejecting the title of art and claiming the title of “science.”[^] The public fascination surrounding the question of “what is art?” turns on precisely this issue. Besides a basic confusion of “art” and “good art,” the debate reflects the fact that there is a public norm which holds that art is an unconditioned good. As such, for anyone to claim the title of art is necessarily for that individual to demand a certain level of public approbation. On the other hand, “science” is also a term of respect, and so the question “What is science?” has a similar level of purchase with the public. 

[^]: For an example of positioning a discipline relative to art in order to calibrate its prestige see: Knuth, Donald. "Computer Programming as Art" in _Communications of the ACM_. Vol. 17 (1974), pp. 667–673.

Frequently, certain activities which might otherwise be taken to be arts (for example, quilting, weaving, or glass blowing) are rejected as mere crafts or skilled traded. On the other side of the coin, those who find modern art distasteful express their distaste not by saying that abstract painting is an inferior art but by claiming that it is not an art at all. Such debates are not dissimilar to the debate among school children about whether cheerleading or gymnastics count as “sports” because they are scored by judges. The arguments given, however worthwhile on their own, are of secondary importance to the deeper cause of the debate, which is an attempt to order the values of society in a certain way. To call cheerleading a sport is to place a stereotypically female activity on a plane with masculine activities. So too, to call Jackson Pollock an artist is to put him in a category of secular veneration alongside Michelangelo and da Vinci.

###Aesthetic subject: Ideal observer or authoritative agent?
In exploring the role of community in creating aesthetic normativity, we had to come to a greater understanding of the nature of subject as communal. However, it is not enough to see this enlarged subject as something disembodied which passively observes the world from a distance through the eyes of the individuals that make it up. We must remember that the subject through which we grasp aesthetic experience should not been seen as a Kantian _cogito_ appended to each of our internal presentation of objects. Rather, the subject is an active subject that inhabits this world physically:

> The attempt to consider "consciousness" by means of epistemology or psychology originates with the modern ego-consciousness, which divides the individual into body and mind and deals with the mind separately from the body. […] But the position of the _cogito_, which takes body as mere "matter," should be submitted to severe criticism. The body is not merely the same as any other object but is basically something subjective. As an observer of phenomena, one's eye is not matter as an object but is observing as a subject. Even the hand of an acting person is not an objective matter but the hand of an acting person. Moreover, apart from the subjective physical body, no human relationships could arise at all.(152)

Further showing the importance of this embodiment is the fact that “subject” is a term which affords multiple possible translations into Japanese.[^] Of particular note for the period in which Watsuji was writing is the distinction between the term _shukan_ 主観 and _shutai_ 主体 when referring to the subject of experience. In both compounds _shukan_ and _shutai_, the _shu_ represents the host or ruler as opposed to a “guest” or one with an objective view _kyakkan_ 客観. The difference between _kan_ and _tai_ is the difference between an “observer” and an “embodied agent.”[^] That is, in the early years of modern Japanese philosophy, the Western subject was considered to be a transcendental observer (_shukan_) but with influence from Marx, Nietzsche, and other sources, the subject was seen as the agent of action (_shutai_). That the Japanese philosophers of this time period made this distinction when treating the subject shows the importance of the body as the ground of the human being.

[^]: For example, the subject of a sentence is 主語 _shugo_. A subject of debate is 主題 _shudai_. A subject in school is 教科 _kyōka_. The subject of a ruler is 臣下 _shinka_. Etc.

[^]: The character for _tai_ in _shutai_ was written as 體 in the pre-war orthography, which reflects the close connection between the physical body and Confucian _li_ 禮 (ritual propriety). That the post-war way of writing _tai_ as 体 existed as variant also reflects the view that the body is the root (本) of the person (人).

One approach to talking about norms in aesthetics has been to couch claims about what constitutes good and bad taste in terms of the reactions of a hypothetical “suitable spectator” or an “ideal observer.” In this framework, taste is that judgment posed by an ideal observer and when faced with the question of rendering a judgment about a particular aesthetic object or event, the correct judgment to render is one that agrees with that of the ideal observer. However, from the perspective of the subject just mentioned it is clear that rather than thinking in terms of an ideal _observer_ or _spectator_ (_shukan_ 主観), we should think in terms of ideal _embodied agents_ or _actors_ (_shutai_ 主体).

###Normativity and agenthood in Japanese linked verse
The nature of the subject of taste as both collective and agentive will be more clear if we examine one of its specific aesthetic manifestations. In _Climate and Culture_ (1935)  Watsuji observes that the aforementioned meeting point of feeling was central to many of the traditional Japanese arts, particularly linked verse. Linked verse is by its nature a collaborative process governed by the chances product of many imaginations rather than a single vision from a lead poet. In it, each poet contributes a verse which connects to the verse immediately before it, but not necessarily in continuity with the poem before that. Through this process, a group of poets would spend the evening creating a kaleidoscopic aesthetic performance in which the perspective of each poem shifts radically when read in juxtaposition with the poem after it rather than before it.  Nevertheless, we do find something that connects these poems together while showing the individuality of the various authors. Watsuji asks,

> Yet how can such chance create artistic unity? Here again the answer lies in “meeting of feeling,” in this case a meeting of the heart. If there is no meeting between the tempers of a gathering of poets, no surpassing linked verse will come of the gathering. While preserving their own individuality, the poets combine their feelings and reveal their individual experience in a symphonic concord of each other's hearts. (196)

As in the Dionysian intoxication described by Nietzsche, there is a certain frame of mind which unites the various poets in spite of their differences, and that this frame of mind can exist at all reveals to us the nature of the human being as both individual and collective. Because the human being is both individual and collective, linked verse is able to show the personality of its many collaborators both individually and collectively without having to negate one for the sake of the other. The structure of the linked verse meeting provides the authors with detachment from their ordinary concerns but their appreciation for their mutually crafted verses allows them to express their hearts openly in a “symphonic concord” of merging perspectives.

To give a concrete example, take this incident in the life of the Japanese poet Bashō (芭蕉). One time a dispute arose about the proper interpretation of his disciple Kyorai’s poem, “On the edge of this rock, / Here is one more / Moon-viewer”:

> Kyorai said, “Shadō asserted that this must be a monkey, but what I intend is another person.” Bashō retorted, “A monkey! What does he mean? What were you thinking when you composed the poem?” Kyorai answered, “As I was walking over the fields and mountains, singing under the light of the full moon, I found, on the edge of a rock, another man filled with poetical excitement.” Bashō said, “In the phrase, ‘There is one more person,’ you announce yourself; in this there is poetry.” […] My poetical taste is below the highest, but in Bashō’s interpretation, there is something fantastic, I think.[^]

[^]: From Blyth, R. H. _Haiku. Volume I: Eastern Culture_. Paperback edition. Tokyo: Hokuseido Press, 1981, p. 343.

About this incident, the translator R.H. Blyth remarks, “we have here the entertaining picture of Bashō telling Kyorai, not what he ought to have said, but what he ought to have meant by what he said” (343). Why is Bashō’s interpretation preferred over Kyorai’s? What is the source of his authority? As the master of Kyorai, Bashō is in a position to offer an authoritative interpretation of Kyorai’s work. Through a lifetime of training, Bashō has made himself able to instantly size up the merits of a haiku. He is able to speak for the poetic betweenness in which they operate. At the same time, one of the reasons that it is Bashō and not someone else who is in that position is that Kyorai as the author had always intended for the poem to be evaluated for someone with the degree of insight that he considered his master to have. Thus, as an author, Kyorai has the authority to invest Bashō with a claim to the authoritative interpretation. Bashō is the “ideal observer” or “suitable spectator” for the poem because he has cultivated his taste to its utmost. But notice that the judgment that Bashō achieved came not through passive contemplation or reflection but through a lifetime of embodied engagement in the poetic arts. Thus, it is better to describe Bashō not as “ideal observer” but as an “authoritative agent.” The connoisseur must be in some sense an accomplished creator who enacts their artistry as an expression of the betweenness out of which the artistic community emerges.

Notice also Basho’s interpretation of the poem: “In the phrase, ‘There is one more person,’ you announce yourself.” The experience of this verse also fits within the structure of detachment and ecstasy. “On the edge of this rock” introduces the scene with detachment. From a distance, the poet is observing a far off mountain peak. Then the poet writes, “There is one more.” From a detached perspective, this merely introduces another object of contemplation. But as Bashō recognizes, the detached perspective must now gain greater depth through its reflexivity. There is one more on the mountain, and I am on the mountain. This leads inexorably to the moment of aesthetic appreciation in which the difference between the poet’s self and the other on the peak are given union in a broader context: they are all moon-viewers, even the edge of the rock. In the moment of the aesthetic gaze, the subject expands to encompass everything, but the authority to speak for that subject is invested foremost in one who has cultivated the ability actively crystalize such moments.
