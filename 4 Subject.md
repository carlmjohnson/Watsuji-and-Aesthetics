##Chapter 4. The Subject of Aesthetic Judgment
<toc />

How do I form my aesthetic judgments as an individual, and how could I ever share my personal, internal, individual aesthetic judgments with any else? Why should I as an individual come to feel compelled in my aesthetic preferences by the preferences of others? What is the source aesthetic agreement? How is it that there are such things as communities of taste? How can deference to such preferences of others possibly be an authentic expression of my subjectivity? Is there anything like normativity in aesthetic judgment or can we only describe our aesthetic feelings without prescribing them?

In the last chapter, we attempted to restore aesthetic experience by focusing how it is felt in everyday experience, where the subject and object are not cleanly distinguished but instead the subject experiences the ecstatic intoxication of seeing things from the perspective of the object. To answer the questions given above we must in this chapter go beyond just the surface experience of aesthetics as _kansei_ [感性][ja] or sensibility towards an understanding of aesthetics as _bigaku_ [美学][ja]---the study of beauty and our judgments about it. Because aesthetic judgment is a form of judgment, it can only be made within the context of a cleanly separated subject and object. The subject looks at the object from outside and evaluates it. Accordingly, in this chapter we will need to look more closely at the nature of subject and the nature of the object before we can satisfactorily explain the source of aesthetic judgment and our methods for carrying it out. Finally, we will look at examples from _renga_ ([連歌][ja], Japanese linked verse) that illustrate our contentions about the nature of the self and judgment.

###Who is the subject?
####Subject as agent
As mentioned previously, Naoki Sakai is critical of what he feels is Watsuji's project of "reducing" the subject to a twofold structure of individual and community as _ningen_. While I feel that Sakai's criticisms are somewhat wide of the mark, he does do a service for readers who are primarily familiar with Watsuji in translation. In _Return to the West/Return to the East_, he notes that the word "subject" has many renderings in Japanese:

> _Shutai_ [[主体][ja]] was introduced into Japanese intellectual vocabulary as a neologism, as one of the translations for "subject," _sujet_, or _Subjekt_, other translations being _shugo_ [[主語][ja]] (propositional subject), _shukan_ [[主観][ja]] (epistemic subject), _shudai_ [[主題][ja]] (thematic subject), _shinmin_ [[臣民][ja]] (subject of the emperor), among others. (119)

While most of these ambiguities are fairly clear even to readers whose primary language is English (the subject of a sentence is plainly a different thing than the subject of a king), those who read Watsuji only in translation are apt to miss the distinction he makes between _shutai_ [主体][ja] and _shukan_ [主観][ja]. In both words, the _shu_ [主][ja] represents the host or ruler as opposed to a “guest” (_kyaku_ [客][ja] from which comes "objectivity," _kyakkansei_ [客観性][ja]). The _kan_ of _shukan_ means to look or to observe, hence _shukan_ indicates the subject as one who passive receives sense data. The _tai_ of _shutai_, on the other hand, means body, hence _shutai_ indicates the subject as embodied agent who is a practical and active.[^] When translating Western works on the nature of the subject into Japanese, those works which consider the subject to be ultimately a transcendental observer tend to be translated using _shukan_, but those under the influence from Marx, Nietzsche, and other sources in which the subject is as the agent of action are translated using _shutai_. For our purposes, the critical aspect of _shutai_ is that it shows the importance of the living body as the ground of the human being.

[^]: The character for _tai_ in _shutai_ was written as [體][zh] in the pre-war orthography, which reflects the close connection between the physical body and Confucian _li_ [禮][zh] (ritual propriety). That the post-war way of writing _tai_ as [体][zh] existed as variant also reflects the view that the body is the root ([本][zh]) of the person ([人][zh]).

For Watsuji, seeing the subject as "'one who observes objects,' that is, the _shukan_" leads to philosophical difficulties in ethics because "the problem of human existence, the problem of linkages of conduct and practice have no connection to the aforementioned isolated _shukan_" (WTZ 10:11). While the view of the subject as observer has its place---certainly theorizing is a part of human existence---it is a *[déformation professionnelle][fr]* to so valorize the arm chair that we give it priority over practical action in our understanding of human existence. As mentioned in chapter, a common thread in East Asian thought is Wang Yang-Ming's slogan _zhi xing he yi_ [知行合一][zh], “Unity of knowledge and practice,” and it because of his familiarity with this culture of thought that Watsuji is critical of that strain of Cartesian thinking in which one sits in one's study and attempts to prove the existence of the other. As he explains in _Study of Ethics_, the attempt shows its own superfluousness in the writing:

> _Writing_ "only the _I_ is a certainty" is a self-contradiction because writing is the expression of words using letters and words are something that develop only in the possession of a partner to live with and speak with.  (WTZ 10:52)

We forget that there's no one out there who could read our disproof of solipsism without already disbelieving in solipsism because we neglect the importance of the body and its practical conduct in favor of a view of the subject as observer. In aesthetics as well as ethics, we must be careful not to elevate the observing subject over the agentive subject if we are to escape certain pitfalls of thought.

One approach to talking about norms in aesthetic judgment has been to couch claims about what constitutes good and bad taste in terms of the reactions of a hypothetical “suitable spectator” or an “ideal observer.” In this framework, taste is that judgment posed by an ideal observer and when faced with the question of rendering a judgment about a particular aesthetic object or event, the correct judgment to render is one that agrees with that of the ideal observer. Richard Wollheim, for example, claims in "On Pictorial Representation" that we can judge the success of representation in a picture on the basis of whether, "if a suitable spectator looks at the picture, he will, other things equal, have the appropriate experience" (396). However, from the perspective on the subject just mentioned it is clear that rather than thinking in terms of an ideal _observer_ or suitable _spectator_ (_shukan_), we should think in terms of ideal _embodied agents_ or appropriate _actors_ (_shutai_).

What this means is that it is not enough for us to think of aesthetics only from the point of view of a passive aesthetic experience as was done in the last chapter. While such a perspective is important to understand, we also need to see that this perspective is itself an embodied activity undertaken by the subject. We not only stumble into beauty, but we actively seek it out as artists and as audiences. We prepare our minds to receive beauty by undertaking actions which open us to the possibility of enjoying disinterested pleasure. The physical activity of walking to the theater or signing one's name in the guestbook at the gallery should not be overlooked when analyzing the aesthetic experience, because these activities allow our bodies to help physically prepare the mindset of distancing and dissolution which will be needed. Even more so in aesthetic judgment, it is important to remember that the form of judgment which we exercise most is practical rather than theoretical. Because our perception is aspectival, the practical judgments we make about the world around us are already built into everyday experience in its most basic form. We judge that the chair is for sitting and the body we see in the distance is a friend with whom we share a relationship. To be a "suitable spectator" for forming an aesthetic judgment therefore requires not only that we take up a certain cognitive stance, but that also that we engage in certain behaviors and activities that will both cultivate and demonstrate our suitability.

####Subject as plural
Thinking of the subject of aesthetic as _shutai_---actively embodied---rather than _shukan_---passively contemplating---leads us to another aspect of the subject. As previously explained, a human being as subject is constantly engaged in a dialectical movement of double negation between the individual and social moments of existence in our persistent relationships. Accordingly, it is misleading to think of the subject of aesthetic judgment as a purely individual. In an earlier work, _Fūdo_ [風土][ja] or _Milieu_, Watsuji explained that

> our insight is that the physical body (_nikutai_ [肉体][ja]) is not simply a "material thing" (_buttai_ [物体][ja]); i.e., the subjectivity (_shutaisei_ [主体性][ja]) of the physical body. However, to the extent that we are limited by traditional *[Anthropologie][de]*, we deal only with the study of individual persons (_hito_ [人][ja]) and not the study of humanity (_ningen_ [人間][ja]). (WTZ 8:17)

Treating the mind and body non-dualistically in terms of an embodied subject requires that we go beyond the study of individual persons to look at how persons come together to form communities. This is because,

> The subjectivity (_shutaisei_ [主体性][ja]) of the physical body depends on the spatiotemporal structure of human existence as its ground. It follows that a subjective physical body is not an isolated physical body. A subjective physical body has a dynamic structure as though it were combining while isolated and isolated in being combined. (WTZ 8:17)

While our individual subjectivities are an important aspect of aesthetic judgment, so too are our social subjectivities. To paint a full picture of aesthetic judgment, we must see how both are constructed. The basis of this construction is precisely, as was just described, that we are actively embodied subjects in addition to being passively contemplating subjects. From the perspective of the passively contemplating subject, the problem of solipsism looms large, but as we saw, the actively embodied subject dissolves the problem of solipsism just by writing about it. 

In chapter two, we looked at this quotation from Watsuji's _Study of Ethics_:

> It cannot be that the consciousness of I who feel the beauty of a picture and the consciousness of Thou towards the same picture are completely independent things. We are feeling the same beauty together. The difference in the way that two people feel can only be compared on the ground of this shared feeling. (WTZ 10:76)

According to conventional philosophical anthropologies, my feelings are mine and therefore completely private. This leads, as we have seen, to a crisis about how shared taste can even be possible. Watsuji's anthropology, however, denies the presupposition that the individual self is atomic and substantive. As a result, we should not be surprised to see Watsuji arguing that "the interpenetration of the consciousnesses of self and other is especially prominent in its emotional aspect" (WTZ 10:74) because,

> In situations where the persistent relationship (_aidagara_ [間柄][ja]) of self and other is extremely intimate and the communal existence is acutely realized, the _I_ shares an identical emotion with the other. (WTZ 10:74)

Because the subject is not only individual but also communal, feelings can arise in the subject as communal then be shared by subjects as individuals and vice versa. In certain circumstances, these feelings are not just similar but the same. Watsuji gives the example of parents who lose a child. The sorrow they feel is not just similar, "the sorrow is for the parents a communal sorrow, thus they feel an *identical* sorrow together" (WTZ 10:74). Because the source of the sorrow is the shared in common, it is right to call it an identical emotion.

Such sharing of intense feelings is what makes comparing aesthetic judgments and the subsequent creation of canons of taste in the art world possible. That such canons exist is an observable fact of everyday experience, so it is conventional anthropology that needs to be on the defensive here, since conventional anthropology renders these canons difficult to explain. However, what about the inverse phenomena? We not only observe that canons of taste are created, we also observe that sometimes canons of taste fail to come together and no particular canon of taste can claim universal assent. As the ancient saying has it, *[de gustibus non disputandum est][la]*. However, unlike a purely collectivist anthropology, the Watsujian anthropology employed here also has a clear answer for why this is so. In the incessant movement of double negation, the communal moment in human existence is matched by a moment individuation.

One clear illustration of the process by which communities of aesthetic taste emerge is gustatory taste. Watsuji writes,

> we *divide* food to taste it. The taste is on the tongue of each person. But can those tastes be *separate tastes*? In the case of dividing and tasting some sugar, do we not taste *an identical sweetness*? Should one person feel the sugar to be bitter, we will immediately treat that person as sick. That is, we will handle it as a case of one being temporarily deprived of the ability to taste an identical sweetness. […] If bodily sensation were something that separated people from each other, such things could not be. (WTZ 10:80)

&nbsp;

We will return to the example of physical taste in the next chapter when we look at the more closely contextual background out of which our judgments of taste arise, but for now suffice it to say that aesthetic judgment always takes place within a social and ethical context. In the aesthetic experience of tasting delicious food, for instance, one nearly loses oneself in rapture to the flavorful sensation of the dish. However, this experience of partial self-dissolution is always made possible first by specific cultural structures. Before we can experience a meeting of subject-object, there must be a coming together of individuals as a collective subject in a society. Hence our understanding of the subject of aesthetic experience can never be limited to an appreciation for the individual’s experience alone, but we must also appreciate the ways in which the communal whole enjoys the aesthetic experience as a subject.

<!--Sharing actions as the basis of our plurality Wittgenstein's ways of life?, Nishida's acting intuition?-->

###What is an object?
Watsuji's _Milieu_ provides another vivid example of the way that our subjective judgments are embodied and shared. Think of standing outside in the cold with an acquaintance. What will you say? Almost certainly, "Whew, sure is cold, huh?" When you say this is the cold that you are feeling the _same_ as the cold that your acquaintance feels? Modern Western philosophers tended to treat the feeling of heat or coolness in objects as a secondary quality rather than a primary quality, which means that for them you are _not_ feeling the same cold. You feel only your own cold in your own mind, and on the basis of this feeling infer a similar feeling may exist within the mind of your acquaintance. However, since you have never been your acquaintance, it is not clear how well rationally grounded this inferential process could be. Watsuji sidesteps this difficulty by affirming what common sense tells us, namely that the cold I feel is the same cold that you feel:

- - - -

> But, as we have been able to use the expression "we feel cold", without any contradiction, it is "we", not "I" alone that experience the cold. We feel the same cold in common. It is precisely because of this that we can use terms describing the cold in our exchange of daily greetings. The fact that the feeling of cold differs between us is possible only on the basis of our feeling
the cold in common. Without this basis it would be quite impossible
: of our selves, and it is on this principle that intentionality depends.
to recognise that any other "I" experiences the cold. (4)

The basis of Watsuji's conclusion here is that,

> The object of intention is not a mental
entity. It is not cold as an experience independent of objective cold
that is the intentional object. When we feel the cold, it is not the
"feeling" of cold,that we feel, but the "coldness of the air" or the
"cold". In other words, the cold felt in intentional experience is
not subjective but objective. It may be said, therefore, that an in- ,
tentional relation in which we feel the cold is itself related to the coldness of the air. (3)

The cold that we feel is an object which we feel yet at the same time it is an object which we find outside of ourselves:

The instant that the cold is discovered, we are already outside in the cold. Therefore, the basic essence of what is "present outside" is not a thing or object such as the cold, but we ourselves. "Ex-sistere" is the fundamental principle of the structure
: of our selves, and it is on this principle that intentionality depends.
That we feel the cold is an intentional experience, in which we discover , our selves in the state of "ex-sistere", or our selves already outside in the cold. (4)



Such self-apprehension is not the recognition of the "I" as the subject that feels the cold and the heat or as the subject.that is glad- dened by the cherry blossoms. In these experiences we do not look towards the "subject". We stiffen, or we put on warm clothes, or
we draw near the brazier when we feel cold. (5)


> (A) The apple is distinct from just an experience or idea of an apple.
>
> (B)  The apple is distinct from just its red-color, its coldish touch, smooth texture and sweet taste, and also from just a series or set of these qualities. 
>
> (C)  The apple that I now touch (or bite or smell) is the same as the apple that I saw a while ago. 
>
> (D)  The apple thatI see is the same as the apple that you see. (105--6)

###The source of normativity in aesthetic judgment

Hence there is a voice which is able to speak with authority about the kinds of taste experiences we “should” be having when we enter into an aesthetic experience. It is the voice of the society as it expresses itself as the source of the individual. Because this voice is trans-personal, it is possible for us as members of a community to discuss our tastes productively. It is not entirely “subjective” in the sense of being entirely individual-relative. On the other hand, since the voice is also the voice of the inmost source of the individual, this voice is “subjective” in the sense of being a part of the subject and able to, at times, command the assent of the subject.


As Watsuji explains in _Study of Ethics_ though there is regional variation in morality---for example, one society may approve of human sacrifice while another condemns it---this does not undermine the universality of the basis of ethics. In all societies what is condemned are actions that undermine the trust basis of that society and what is praised are actions that reinforce the trust basis of that society. But if this is the case, how is it that we as individual members of society feel the call of conscience? If these values are being imposed on us from without in order to preserve society, then it is not clear why as individuals we should feel an *inner* impulse towards a morality made to preserve *outer* order. In that case, moral education is a kind of deformation of the person by which the individual is trained to ignore her authentic desires and interests and produce within herself a feeling of subordination to the order outside of her. Could it be that our call of conscience really be the result of a super-ego that is essential alien to us? Watsuji argues no. In the determination of guilt by a court of law, the one who accuses me stands in for society as whole, but in an affliction of conscience, the one who accuses me is the very emptiness at the heart of my self. In spite of the great degree of social determination that undoubtably goes into the formation of conscience, when we truly feel the call of conscience it does not feel to us as something coming from without but it feels as though it was coming from our inmost personality. 

The reason for this should already be somewhat clear from our prior discussion of Watsuji’s anthropology. When we understand the subject correctly, we see it as arising out of the negation of the emptiness that stands prior to the individual or the community. As such, the call of conscience does not arise as an external voice speaking for society but as an internal voice speaking for the authentic source of the subject. As Watsuji writes, “an established betweenness is […] authenticity as a the ground out of which we, fundamentally speaking, come forth” (187). Again, Watsuji is fundamentally an existentialist in his ethics, since he sees expressing the individual authentically as the source of ethical normativity, but where Watsuji differs from other existentialists is that he is clear that authenticity comes from a return to the source of our being according to the fundamental law of human existence and that source is our persistent relationships.

Watsuji explicitly links his discussion of conscience to Mencius<!--§-->, who coined the term [良心][zh], which evolved eventually into the term _ryōshin_ in Japanese and _liangxin_ in Modern Standard Mandarin and is used to translate the English word “conscience.” In the Warring States period, there was a debate about whether moral appropriateness ([義][zh] _yi_) was _nei_ [内][zh] (roughly speaking, “internal”) or _wai_ [外][zh] (“external”). There have been various interpretations of the exact meaning of this debate, but we may on a loose reading take it that they wanted to know whether morality is in some ways dependent on the dispositions of the individual or if moral normativity can be imposed on the individual from without by completely impersonal formal considerations. For his part, Mencius claims that our sense of the appropriate must be _nei_ even as it responds to conditions in the world. I argue that what Mencius means by this is not that morality is ‘subjective’ in the sense of being determined only by the individual, but that morality is _nei_ in the sense that it originates in our most inner and authentic self even as it is importantly interpenetrated by our relationships with others. Mencius and his interlocutors agree that one can take  gustatory taste---savoring a roast or wanting a drink of water---as paradigmatic example of _nei_ (_Mencius_ 6A.4 and 6A.5). Mencius points out that these tastes, while paradigmatically internal, are nevertheless respondent to external conditions. On a hot day, I would like a cold drink, but on a cold day, I would like a hot drink. My wanting a particular kind of drink on the basis of these external circumstances cannot be the result of some coercive education in inauthenticity. If these sorts of desires are not authentic, then there are no authentic desires. In the same way, argues Mencius, our sense of what is appropriate must respond to external circumstances (and should it fail to respond it would be an error, just as it is an error to desire salt water in a desert), but it nevertheless the internality of the sense of appropriateness which gives it jurisdiction with which to compel us. 

In Watsuji’s language, we may state this same idea somewhat differently. Legitimate compulsion of the individual can only arise from the source of the individual, that is, from the subject, but the subjective origin of this compulsion does not mean that it is only a matter of what one particular person feels. The subject is not only individual. In our everyday experience, it is possible for social structures seemingly outside of the individual such as the family, community, or state to compel the individual, but this does not mean that they can exercise their authority insofar as they are external. They have authority only insofar as they are constitutive of one as a person. As he explains, 

> A family or a state, as instances of socio-ethical wholes, has the authority to demand obedience from individuals, but this demand cannot be authorized merely from the standpoint of a family or a state. (125)

If it is not as socio-ethical wholes that these institutions speak authoritatively, on whose behalf are they speaking? Socio-ethical wholes have the authority to compel just to the degree that they speak for the betweenness out which both they and the individual arise. Because the source of the individual and the social whole is the same, the one is on occasion able to speak for the other as the voice of its autonomous subject. This means both that the state is able to compel the citizen to follow its (just) laws and that the citizen is able compel the state to reform its unjust laws. The basis for both forms of compulsion is the mutual dependance of the two: the individual could not be who she is without her state, and the state could not exist without its individuals. At its best, the relationship of the citizen and the state is one of virtuosic mutual contribution. 




We may apply this understanding of the internality of conscience and morality to the normativity of aesthetic judgment by analogy to fashion: if the fashion choices we make are imposed on us from outside---and they certainly are, otherwise it would not just so happen that men in the West wear shirts and pants, whereas men in other cultures have worn robes, etc., etc.---then why do we feel as though when I dress I put on clothes that reflect _my_ taste in clothing? Has the outside force of fashion education deformed my authentic sartorial feelings? 

Watsuji argues to the contrary that fashion is an everyday experience of a kind of communal consciousness:

> What makes this communal consciousness manifest in a particularly 
> bold form, is the phenomenon of "fashion." Fashion makes its 
> appearance within the modes of clothing, food, and housing already 
> historically and nationally fixed as more detailed common 
> favorites. Even though individuals did not, to begin with, become 
> conscious of a common favorite as their own, nevertheless, they do 
> feel it to be their own favorite to the extent that they are inclined to 
> view deviations from this favorite as either something funny or 
> ugly. (74–5)

In other words, in fashion our aesthetic norms originate outside of the particular individual, but they are nevertheless felt as the subjective tastes of individuals because those individuals are ultimately expressions through negation of the prior betweenness. Society may help shape my taste in fashion, but it is still _my_ taste. At the same time, however, by changing my taste in fashion, it is possible for me to change society’s taste in fashion. The two forms of taste are mutually entailing and are ultimately expressions of the ways in which I as individual am made in part by the fashion of my society and my society is made in part by me.

###Forming aesthetic judgments
###The attitude of the critic
###The interconnection of subjects in _renga_
The nature of the subject of taste as both collective and agentive will be more clear if we examine one of its specific aesthetic manifestations. In _Climate and Culture_ (1935)  Watsuji observes that the aforementioned meeting point of feeling was central to many of the traditional Japanese arts, particularly linked verse. Linked verse is by its nature a collaborative process governed by the chances product of many imaginations rather than a single vision from a lead poet. In it, each poet contributes a verse which connects to the verse immediately before it, but not necessarily in continuity with the poem before that. Through this process, a group of poets would spend the evening creating a kaleidoscopic aesthetic performance in which the perspective of each poem shifts radically when read in juxtaposition with the poem after it rather than before it.  Nevertheless, we do find something that connects these poems together while showing the individuality of the various authors. Watsuji asks,

> Yet how can such chance create artistic unity? Here again the answer lies in “meeting of feeling,” in this case a meeting of the heart. If there is no meeting between the tempers of a gathering of poets, no surpassing linked verse will come of the gathering. While preserving their own individuality, the poets combine their feelings and reveal their individual experience in a symphonic concord of each other's hearts. (196)

As in the Dionysian intoxication described by Nietzsche, there is a certain frame of mind which unites the various poets in spite of their differences, and that this frame of mind can exist at all reveals to us the nature of the human being as both individual and collective. Because the human being is both individual and collective, linked verse is able to show the personality of its many collaborators both individually and collectively without having to negate one for the sake of the other. The structure of the linked verse meeting provides the authors with detachment from their ordinary concerns but their appreciation for their mutually crafted verses allows them to express their hearts openly in a “symphonic concord” of merging perspectives.

To give a concrete example, take this incident in the life of the Japanese poet Bashō (芭蕉). One time a dispute arose about the proper interpretation of his disciple Kyorai’s poem, “On the edge of this rock, / Here is one more / Moon-viewer”:

> Kyorai said, “Shadō asserted that this must be a monkey, but what I intend is another person.” Bashō retorted, “A monkey! What does he mean? What were you thinking when you composed the poem?” Kyorai answered, “As I was walking over the fields and mountains, singing under the light of the full moon, I found, on the edge of a rock, another man filled with poetical excitement.” Bashō said, “In the phrase, ‘There is one more person,’ you announce yourself; in this there is poetry.” […] My poetical taste is below the highest, but in Bashō’s interpretation, there is something fantastic, I think.[^]

[^]: From Blyth, R. H. _Haiku. Volume I: Eastern Culture_. Paperback edition. Tokyo: Hokuseido Press, 1981, p. 343.

About this incident, the translator R.H. Blyth remarks, “we have here the entertaining picture of Bashō telling Kyorai, not what he ought to have said, but what he ought to have meant by what he said” (343). Why is Bashō’s interpretation preferred over Kyorai’s? What is the source of his authority? As the master of Kyorai, Bashō is in a position to offer an authoritative interpretation of Kyorai’s work. Through a lifetime of training, Bashō has made himself able to instantly size up the merits of a haiku. He is able to speak for the poetic betweenness in which they operate. At the same time, one of the reasons that it is Bashō and not someone else who is in that position is that Kyorai as the author had always intended for the poem to be evaluated for someone with the degree of insight that he considered his master to have. Thus, as an author, Kyorai has the authority to invest Bashō with a claim to the authoritative interpretation. Bashō is the “ideal observer” or “suitable spectator” for the poem because he has cultivated his taste to its utmost. But notice that the judgment that Bashō achieved came not through passive contemplation or reflection but through a lifetime of embodied engagement in the poetic arts. Thus, it is better to describe Bashō not as “ideal observer” but as an “authoritative agent.” The connoisseur must be in some sense an accomplished creator who enacts their artistry as an expression of the betweenness out of which the artistic community emerges.

Notice also Basho’s interpretation of the poem: “In the phrase, ‘There is one more person,’ you announce yourself.” The experience of this verse also fits within the structure of detachment and ecstasy. “On the edge of this rock” introduces the scene with detachment. From a distance, the poet is observing a far off mountain peak. Then the poet writes, “There is one more.” From a detached perspective, this merely introduces another object of contemplation. But as Bashō recognizes, the detached perspective must now gain greater depth through its reflexivity. There is one more on the mountain, and I am on the mountain. This leads inexorably to the moment of aesthetic appreciation in which the difference between the poet’s self and the other on the peak are given union in a broader context: they are all moon-viewers, even the edge of the rock. In the moment of the aesthetic gaze, the subject expands to encompass everything, but the authority to speak for that subject is invested foremost in one who has cultivated the ability actively crystalize such moments.
