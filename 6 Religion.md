###The attitude of the critic
Having looked at the nature of the subject and the object, I will begin our investigation into aesthetic judgment itself by asking what attitude is a precondition for meaningful criticism. One approach to criticism is to be critical, that is, to criticize. One can search the object closely for faults in order to seize on them and present them to its creator and others. This attitude, however, is clearly of more use in fostering one’s reputation among fellow connoisseurs than it is for allowing one to aesthetically engage with the object. It has its place, but it is not strictly aesthetic. 

In a short essay entitled “Art Criticism” (_Geijutsu Hihyō_ [芸術批評][ja]), Watsuji explains his approach and the approach of the French philosopher Jean-Marie Guyau (1854--1888) to criticism. Both are opposed to the brand of criticism that seeks only to tear down. Watsuji interprets Guyau’s view as being, “one who we ought to call a critic is one who best sings praises to the beautiful and also one best able to explain this praise to others” (WTZ 17:189). While agreeing with this sentiment, Watsuji feels that we must not lose sight of the source of criticizing criticism either. In his view, “The ideal critic knows best how to praise beauty, while also being at the same time the most sensitive towards the ugly” (WTZ 17:190). When the critic criticizes, it should not be out of a desire to impress others with one’s snobbish sophistication, but out of a sensitivity to the ways that object came so close to achieving greatness but fell short.

The attitude a critic must possess in order to simultaneously praise the beautiful and criticize the bad is, Watsuji and Guyau agree, love. Love, of course, can be understood in many ways beyond even the traditional Greek distinctions between [ἀγάπη][el] (“charitable love”), [ἔρως][el] (“erotic love”), [φιλία][el] (“brotherly love”), and [στοργή][el] (“familial affection”). To add in distinctions from the East Asian tradition, we might also mention [慈悲][zh] (Ch. _cibei_, Jp. _jihi_, “compassion”),  [戀][zh] (Ch. *lian*, Jp. _koi_, “yearning love”), [愛][zh] (Ch. _ai_, Jp. _ai_, “possessive love”), and [仁][zh] (Ch. _ren_, Jp. _jin_, “humane conduct”). Each of these concepts of love has a different shade of meaning that has evolved historically and each reveals a different aspect of the attitude needed for aesthetic judgment, but the thread that runs through them as concepts is the sense of outward yearning concern.

In _Study of Ethics_, Watsuji mentions one view of love given by Hegel (WTZ 10:87). I believe Hegel captures something common to our conceptions of love in his _Philosophy of Right_:

> Love is in general the consciousness of the unity of myself with another. I am not separate and isolated, but win my self-consciousness only by renouncing my independent existence, and by knowing myself as unity of myself with another and of another with me. […] The first element in love is that I will to be no longer an independent self-sufficing person, and that, if I were such a person, I should feel myself lacking and incomplete. The second element is that I gain myself in another person, in whom I am recognized, as he again is in me. Hence love is the most tremendous contradiction, incapable of being solved by the understanding. Nothing is more obstinate than this scrupulosity of self-consciousness, which, though negated, I yet insist upon as something positive. Love is both the source and solution of this contradiction. As a solution it is an ethical union. (§158, 139)

Watsuji summarizes, “love is the contradiction that to abandon oneself is to acquire oneself” (WTZ 10:88). For the purposes of understanding aesthetic judgment, what love must mean is one’s identity as a subject requires a willingness to go beyond one’s horizons while accepting the otherness of the object. That is, love desires the other without needing to possess it or smother it. To the contrary, the lover finds herself only by losing herself to the beloved. The feeling of disinterested enjoyment rests on just this. 

In Plato’s _Symposium_, Aristophanes tells a myth about the origin of love. Once, human beings were wholes with four arms, four legs, and two faces, but now we have been divided into halves as punishment by the gods. As a result, we spend our lives searching for our lives in search of a lover to complete us, that is, searching for our other halves:

> Why should this be so? It’s because, as I said, we used to be complete wholes in our original nature, and now “Love” is the name for our pursuit of wholeness, for our desire to be complete. (192e)

The form of love that makes criticism possible is similar in that it too is a drive to reunify in cleavage what was originally together without division. In aesthetic judgment, we are not just looking for another person to complete us, but for oneness with the emptiness out of which subject and object co-arise. This return with difference is the foundation of aesthetic goodness and the drive that compels our experiences to evolve in progressively novel forms.

To be sure, an overemphasis on the word “love” as the attitude of the critic can lead to a misunderstanding of what aesthetic judgment calls for. Again, the critic must always be ready to criticize the ugliness of the ugly. While this is compatible with a deeper understanding of love, it easily becomes obscured if our concept of love is too shallow. Another way of conceptualizing the attitude needed for aesthetic judgment that may prevent this misunderstanding is as empathy. The word “empathy” was coined as a translation of the German *[Einfühlung][de]*, which was popularized by German philosopher Theodor Lipps (1851--1914).[^fn4-6] Watsuji mentions Lipps in his unfinished notes on art theory and wrote about him several times in his early work, _Revival of the Idols_ (_Guzō Saikō_ [偶像再興][ja]).[^fn4-7] The German *[Einfühlung][de]* and the Greco-English “empathy” are both compounds meaning “in feeling.” The preposition “in” suggest that while outside the thing being empathized with, we nevertheless enter into it ecstatically. We feel from our position as subjects into the position of the object. In doing so, we come together with our fellow appreciators, the artist, and---most importantly---the object itself.

###Locating the genius in an ethos
These considerations of the importance of context in climate and history naturally lead us to reflect on the nature of genius in art. Genius seems to develop within history and redirect its course. Genius seems to begin in a particular climactic location but then cross its bounds and become a global phenomenon. It seems as though the greatest works of art are those that function even beyond their original contexts (think of the Venus de Milo, which was originally a religious artifact) and the greatest artists are those who create new standards for art (think of Picasso). Kant writes that, “_Genius_ is the innate mental predisposition (_ingenium_) _through which_ nature gives the rule to art.”[^] On Kant’s theory, genius is the talent of the individual to create new rules of taste to match our indeterminate concept of beauty, rather than any communal capacity (though it is through this capacity that communal nature speaks). However, if we examine the concept of genius more closely, we find, as Hegel emphasizes, genius must express “the spirit of the times.” For one to paint like Picasso in the Renaissance would not have gotten one far, and to paint like Picasso today is merely to be an imitator. 

[^]: Kant, Immanuel. _Critique of Judgment_. Tr. Werner S. Pluhar. Indianapolis: Hackett Publishing, 1987, §46, Ak. 307.

Based on the foregoing discussion it should be clear that, examined according to Watsuji’s perspective, genius must not be seen as the possession of an individual alone. Rather, we should see it as the ability to crystallize the historical and climactic conditions of the public in a never before seen expression that gives rise to a new space of possibilities to project. Similarly, those great works of art like the Venus de Milo are great because they bring their ideals with them when they travel and instantly reconfigure the cultures into which they are introduced. Genius then should be seen not so much as ability to bring a rule of nature to art as an ability to bring an object out of its context by expanding its context in unexpected new directions. What makes genius so fascinating is not just the individual accomplishment of a particular work or object, but the social achievement of an ability to create or alter the existing ethos of an aesthetic community. Genius is made possible by the pre-condition of a certain historical and climactic culture which it expresses, but genius goes beyond its origin to alter the possibility of future aesthetic experiences.

Hiroshi Nara claims in “Art and Ethics in Watsuji Tetsurō's Philosophy” that Watsuji’s aesthetics leaves art with

> no power to give birth to a new form of art which can challenge the status quo of society, including art. This is because moral laws, which artists must abide by, come from the absolute negation of the autonomous self. And only in this way, that is, by means of emptying the self into the totality of the nation, a person can be one with the nation. For an artist, there is no art that is subversive or produced to fulfill personal emancipation in Watsuji's framework. (113)

Nara is correct to claim that for Watsuji the artist emerges out of the social fabric of morality, but he is wrong to claim that Watsuji thereby suppresses all possibility of genius or historical change. It is precisely as a moralist that Watsuji feels qualified to speak to the ability of art and genius to subvert present art forms and advance history. For Watsuji, local ethics follow the local ethos--the local way of life--according to the patterns described by universal ethics. As the local ethos changes, so too will local ethics. The artist who attempts to fashion an aesthetic experience is naturally limited by the contours of society as it presently exists, since it will be impossible for the artist to facilitate distance and ecstasy in relation to an object if the structure of society does not allow for such the reception of such objects. The paintings of Pollock could never have gained an audience in the salons of the 1850’s, for example, which means they would not have provoked an aesthetic experience for anyone at that time. When society has changed or is changing, however, a great artist is to become aware of the possibilities this creates and express those possibilities in art in such a way that a new category of aesthetic experience opens up. Genius gives the rule to art, but only in those historical and climatic milieux in which the rule can be successfully taken up. The genius of Japanese tea ceremony or flower arranging, for example, were never taken up in the West, but Japanese _ukiyo-e_ woodblock prints directly inspired van Gogh, and through him influenced all Western painting following the post-Impressionist period.

This last example allows us to better understand the phenomenon of persistent aesthetic disagreement. It should be readily apparent from what has already been said that the climatic and historical difference between different communities may inhibit the emergence of shared canons of taste for the different groups. It is not a coincidence, for example, that we often observe opposition to the way of life presupposed by hip-hop music as coinciding with opposition to the music itself. The music is an expression of a form of living and to oppose the one is naturally entangled with opposition of the other. On the other hand, we must also consider more closely the issue of aesthetic disagreements within a community. It may be the case that one individual with an otherwise ordinary background opposes some well regarded figure in the canon of an aesthetic community. This too we can account for on Watsuji’s theory as a natural expression of the fundamental law of humanity. The individual defines herself as an individual by negation of her society. Without some form of opposition to the view of the public, there could be no defined individuals to speak of. What is more, we find that as an isolated opinion such a view will not rise to the level of a sustained disagreement within the aesthetic community; however, should such a view gain wider prevalence it will do so either by splitting the community into two opposed factions with different canons of taste or by causing the evolution of the community’s tastes to better reflect its current forms of life.

##Chapter 6. The Aesthetic, Moral, and Religious Values of an Ethos
<!-- Is there any link between beauty and (moral) goodness? Is aesthetics independent or is it subordinate to other concerns? How does aesthetics relate to religion? Let’s use tea as an example somewhere. It’s semi-religious. -->
###Moral value and aesthetic value
As Hume observes in “Of the Standard of Taste” when we look at old paintings we can forgive those depicted their outdated fashions but when we read an old text, we are hard pressed to forgive what we see as the moral shortcomings of the past.[^] Why should there be such a difference in our attitudes? Did not past morality emerge out of the same field of subjectivity as past tastes in fashion? 

[^]: “Must we throw aside the pictures of our ancestors, because of their ruffs and fardingales? But where the ideas of morality and decency alter from one age to another, and where vicious manners are described, without being marked with the proper characters of blame and disapprobation, this must be allowed to disfigure the poem, and to be a real deformity.”

We can explain this seeming difference by recalling the nature of authoritative connoisseur: to develop taste requires cultivation through action. Cultivating a love for past fashions risks perhaps causing one to pick up an anachronistic personal style; cultivating a love for past moralities risks ethical disaster. There is some asymmetry here, but the asymmetry is more quantitative than qualitative. We find it easier to shed our inhibitions about imaginatively engaging in past tastes than engaging past ethics, but it is the potential consequences of such engagement that causes the degree of difference between the two.

Kant in the _Critique of Judgment_ allows that beauty can be a symbol of morality (§59) but nevertheless maintains that they are and must be distinct. For Kant, beauty is apart from all interest whereas morality depends on a certain kind of interest--interest in duty for its own sake. It is easy to see the basic point of Kant’s claim that aesthetics must be disinterested. Suppose for example one looks at nude with a certain kind of interest. In that case, the nude is no longer art but pornography. The stars for Kant are the aesthetic objects _par excellence_ exactly because we can never hope to possess them. On the other hand, we must not be disinterested about our moral progress but must hope to someday be worthy of the moral law within us.

However, Kant’s disinterested interest is not the only way that we can properly separate an aesthetic gaze from a merely instrumental gaze. Another approach is to look towards the object with sympathy for the way it exists from its own perspective. In other words, to see things with “compassion.” Such a stance is preeminently ethical, yet can also serve as the basis for aesthetic experience as well. (“Compassion” is a Buddhist name for this stance, but other traditions contain similar accepting perspectives, such as Confucianism’s _shu_ 恕 or Christianity’s [αγάπη][gr].) By looking on an object with compassion, we are able to appreciate what is good for the object apart from how the object could be instrumentally good for us. In the moment of ecstatic unity with the object, we do not seek to annihilate it or change it, but delight in its being what it is. In the feeling of beauty we get the sense that everything is in its right place and take joy from the goodness of the object.

In the case of human beings, it clear how compassion can arise within a _ningen_ anthropology--the I and the Thou who face each other both arise out of the same human betweenness and so have a common basis that allows them to share feelings without collapsing into one entity. But what about non-human entities? Here Watsuji seems to depart from his Buddhist influences in deference to his Western ones, because he seems to mark a great divide between human beings and non-human entities. While not meaning to slight the important differences between humans and non-humans, I feel that Watsuji’s philosophy would be corrected here by recalling that in the Buddhist tradition everything is empty, not only human beings. Because of this, and because of our microcosmic similarity to things in this world, we are able to have compassion (literally, to feel together with) for non-human entities as well as human ones, and in doing so, we are able to aesthetically appreciate them while also properly ethically comporting ourselves to them.

###Religion and aesthetics
We have seen so far the deep relationship between social structures and the possibility of aesthetic experience and aesthetic judgment. However, religion also manifests itself ethically and socially, and moreover, it often does so through an appeal to aesthetic feeling. Hence it should be no surprise that throughout his career, Watsuji grappled with the role of religion in human existence. However, critics of Watsuji often contend that in his system he subordinated religion to the role of the state. These criticism are not without merit but must placed within the broader context of Watsuji’s life and career. In his earliest years, he followed Bernard Shaw, the English Romantics, and even Nietzsche in rejecting religion as an outmoded influence on society, but as time went on he began to reconsider its importance, but by the time of his _Revival of the Idols_ (1918), he had begun to shift his emphasis. Where for Nietzsche “idols” represent congealments of life that ought to be destroyed, Watsuji saw also their positive role in the progression of life. In “The Psychology of Idol Worship,” Watsuji explores the mindset of those Japanese who first accepted the foreign importation of Buddhism to Japan. Watsuji writes,

> What especially catches the eye is that they demanded artistic joy [*geijutsu-teki na kanki* 芸術的な歓喜] from religion. Going further than that, they tied their faith to this sensuous joy. The former is proved by the great art that was born of the Nara period. The latter is unquestionably proven by several prominent social phenomena which manifest how much power the priests of that era held over the human body. These characteristics may have varied in form to some degree but are surely apparent in every religion that has since been born in Japan. For example, the Dionysian elements (the physical movements and type of dance involved) in the Nichiren sect and the nembutsu sects provide prominent examples of this religious joy. However, while what appeared later was fairly strongly practical, in more ancient times it was especially and distinctly artistic. This close melding of art and religion is able to provide an extremely justified ground for idol worship.[^]

[^]: Translations from _Revival of the Idols_ are my own.

In other words, the ancient Japanese came to accept Buddhism as a religion first because of their love of the aesthetic, artistic joy it provided, and only later for its intellectual elements. Japanese Buddhism went through several distinct phases, starting with its establishment in the Nara period (710–794 CE). Where the earlier forms of Buddhism were more austere and aristocratic, later forms of Buddhism emphasized the efficacy of personal, popular devotion. In the Nichiren sect, it is held that the salvific power of the Lotus Sutra can be unlocked through the use of the proper mantras and mandalas, and the various nembutsu (念仏) sects held that keeping in mind (_nen_ 念) the name of the Buddha (_butsu_ 仏) of Infinite Light through chanting held life transforming power in this world and the next. Nichiren (日蓮, 1222–1282) was a Buddhist teacher who emphasized the importance of chanting _Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō_ (南無妙法蓮華経, “Hail to the Wonderful Law of the Flowering Lotus Sutra”) while meditating before a _Gohonzon_ 御本尊, a special mandala of Nichiren’s design. There are a variety of nembutsu sects (prominently, Hōnen [法然,1133–1212]’s Pure Land sect and Shinran [親鸞, 1173–1263]’s True Pure Land sect), but in general they emphasize that calling on the Buddha Amitābha by chanting _Namu Amida Butsu_ (南無阿弥陀仏, “Hail to the Buddha of Infinite Light”) will allow one to be reborn in the Pure Land in the next life, where salvation is much easier to achieve than in this world. However, Watsuji felt that these later forms of Buddhism were more practically oriented in comparison to earlier forms of Buddhism. Though the latter Buddhist sects did have strong aesthetic components, what allowed for the introduction of Buddhism in the first place was its direct aesthetic attractiveness. Again in Watsuji’s description of these Buddhist adherents, we see a structured detachment followed by an aesthetic rapture in the scene of those at a temple gathering listening to chanting of the monks:

> They who were intoxicated [_tōsui_ 陶酔] on music would sometimes open their enchanted eyes and gaze on the heavenly idols. They had already lost consciousness of themselves. They had already integrated the idols into their hearts, and in an infinity of gratitude and blessings they experienced an intense shining and a nimbleness of the whole heart.--Actually, their agitated hearts were extremely sensitive toward the statues and music. The strength and chiaroscuro of that inner life was no different in its extreme intensity of feeling, though it could not be called well defined. When all of their artistic results and religious influences were concentrated on just one point, that is, the veneration of idols, especially as in the aforementioned circumstances, the depth and strength of that ecstasy [_uchōten_ 有頂天] seems to be almost beyond our imaginations. In this way, our ancestors had tasted one kind of aesthetico-religious great joy [_bi-teki shūkyō-teki na dai-kanki_ 美的宗教的な大歓喜] in idol worship.

While the strong influence of Nietzsche’s thinking on Watsuji is apparent in this passage, we also see the beginnings of Watsuji’s independence. What Watsuji has shown is that the rigid structure and rules of Buddhism, anathema to the Dionysian Nietzsche, have provided the space in which the Japanese devotees can experience an aesthetic rapture together. The rapture of the monks was made possible first by their commitment to detachment from the world, which was the precondition of their losing themselves to the world. The turn from Nietzsche to Buddhism was natural for Watsuji once he found in Buddhism a similar appreciation for the importance of appreciating the flow of life unimpeded by conceptual congealing, but it also meant Watsuji was gaining appreciation for the positive value of idols, both literal and conceptual. Where Nietzsche casually sneers at the inauthenticity of Buddhism’s life negating tendencies (they are guilty of “denying the will”[^] and “longing for nothingness”[^]), Watsuji began to appreciate life affirming aspect of self-negation in the face of an awesome aesthetic other. Nietzsche was only aware of a caricatured portrait of South Asian non-Mahāyāna Buddhism, but Watsuji was thoroughly acquainted with both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna Buddhism, which gave him a better perspective on the ways in which Buddhism could be life affirming and embrace aesthetic experience. While both Watsuji and Nietzsche emphasize the importance of intoxication to the opening of the self to the Dionysian joy of aesthetic/religious ecstasy, Watsuji also begins to sympathize with the veneration of the idols as well, which is an act that would strike Nietzsche as servile and a betrayal of the will to power. As David B. Gordon argues, however, the common thread connecting Watsuji’s work before and after _A Study of Nietzsche_ is Watsuji’s recognition of the overcoming of self as the means of expressing the authenticity of the self.

In his preface to _Revival of the Idols_, Watsuji expands the themes of the essays in the collection by illustrating his point with the story of the Apostle Paul. According to Watsuji, Paul was disgusted by the Dionysian excesses of the ancient Athenians, and managed to so impress them with his disdain for idolatry that a period of iconoclasm followed for the better part of two millennia. Watsuji allows that this was for the best historically, and yet we cannot wholly rid ourselves of the idols:

> There is no need at this time to repeat that iconoclasm, or the destruction of idols, is indispensable as a way for life to progress. The flow of life is maintained by this path [*michi* 道] alone. Idols, which we unceasingly construct in our subconsciouses, must be destroyed by careful and unceasing effort.
>
> And yet, it is not that these idols are created without meaning. They ought to give a strength that has unity in the flow of life and guide the growth of life toward a healthy abundance and beauty. This is the indispensable duty which they have in our way of life. Stuck without them between the confusion of consciousness and the division of desires, a person will end up stunted. It is possible that some will even go so far as treating "nihility" [*kyomu* 虚無] as an idol in order to be able to lead a life of positivity.

What finally brought an end to the era of iconoclasm in the West was a literal return of the idols of the past. Ancient Greek and Roman statues were restored to positions of honor in society. However, their new position was by no means identical to what it had been before the period of iconoclasm:

> Nevertheless, idols that have been revived are no longer gods deserving of veneration. No one thought to offer before them a beast in sacrifice. No one thought to entrust his own fate into the hands of these idols. What caused the people tremble was not their being heretical gods but their beauty. Paul's expulsion of idols is something that should have been accepted as a matter of course only to the degree that the idols were taken to be gods for veneration. However, as works of art which are venerated for their beauty, the idols were offered unfair treatment by Paul. Now that unfair treatment is being recompensed, and the idols are seen by the people as possessing a dignity even as mere works of art.

In other words, statues like the Venus de Milo continue to possess a kind of awe inspiring power, but we no longer feel that power to be a religious one, but primarily an artistic one. This shows at the same time, the change brought about in the status of religion and the change in the status of art. New iconoclasts in the form of anti-clerical and even atheistic movements had taken root in the West, but their iconoclasm could not be total. So soon as they suppressed God, they found that they had to put “Art” on a pedestal. Watsuji writes,

> The Christian "God" is also a kind of idol. Paul expelled idols made by "the hands of men." The modern iconoclasts expelled gods made by "the heads of men." However, just as Paul could not completely purge the idols, the modern iconoclasts were also unable to completely purge God. Even after the much-discussed pronouncement that "God is dead,” a god-seeking heart stealthily takes root in the breast of the people.
>
> […]
>
> Though we have lost the name of God, nevertheless we cannot refrain from searching for a new name to give Him. Should we call Him "the Will”? Ought we to speak of Him as "the Absolute"? Or might we call Him "the Electron” as well? Perhaps these names ought to be cast out by a new Paul as demonic gods. We have built an altar to "the Unknown God" and await the appearance of a Paul that can clearly preach about God to us. And so we anticipate the destruction of all of the idols created by the spirit of modernity.

For his part, Watsuji sees both iconoclasm and idol worship as necessary moments in a process of historical unfolding. Neither can exist without the other, because they both bring us closer to discovering the hidden depths of the ordinary. There is a mysterious profundity in how things are on their own that is overlooked by ordinary consciousness but which we can recover when we use aesthetic awareness to alert us to the ecstatic interiority of things:

> I preach the path of righteousness. I suppose some will call this banal. I, however, am talking about the joy of discovering new life in the banal. I am trying to tell you about the sweetness of the nectar secreted away inside the shell of the banal. As for the banal--fixed ideas that are taken to have no life--we needs must first shake the dulled senses out of their sleep by waking [_satoru_ 悟る] the shell itself and then wield an iron hammer to break it apart. The eyes of new senses will for the first time be awakened to the revival of the idols. 
>
> I do not, however, merely aim to "resurrect the old." When the old is raised up again, the old shell is cast off and a new life shines forth. The fetters of time no longer apply in this new life. It is eternally young, eternally new. My aim is in this way to extoll the eternally present life. I feel a presentiment of a great path that converges in the heart of all idols. And I feel that all human efforts, past and future, in extremis will be gathered in the direction of this path.

Thus we see that for the early Watsuji, religion is not just a means of ethnic self-expression whereby the state comes to enlist higher ideals for its legitimation. At its best, religion is a means to aesthetic appreciation of the eternal in every moment. The difficulty is that over time religions inevitably evolve into mere “idol worship” and must be smashed by iconoclasm so that the innate impulse to religiosity can find new and better ways of expressing itself without being stifled by frozen conceptions of how things ought to be. While this understanding of religion does not make up for the shortcomings of Watsuji’s later “idolization” of the state, it helps put into perspective how such idolization came about, in that he came to identify the state with that power which drives the cycle of idolization and iconoclasm forward.
