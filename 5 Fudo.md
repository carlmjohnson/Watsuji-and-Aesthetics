##Chapter 5. Milieu, History, and Genius
###Spatial and temporal aspects of the subject
Although Watsuji has given use picture of the subjective origin of our ethical and aesthetic values, we nevertheless cannot neglect a consideration of the historical, cultural, and environmental forces which construct our subjectivity. In doing so, we can better understand why it is that in aesthetics we find agreement varies both historically and regionally as communities of taste arise and perish in particular parts of the world. This task Watsuji took up in his 1935 work _Climate and Culture_. _Climate and Culture_ is called _Fūdo_ 風土 in Japanese, which means roughly “climate” or “milieu” and is written with the characters wind (風) and soil (土). The title also relates to the _Fūdoki_ 風土記, an eighth century chronicle of the geography, culture, and customs of the provinces of old Japan. The Japanese dictionary _Daijisen_ 大辞泉 defines _fūdo_ as, 

> 1\. Regional weather, soil, topography, and so on.<br />
> <br />
> 2\. The spiritual environment as it affects the form of human cultures. (Translation mine)

In other words, _fūdo_ refers not only to the external conditions of the weather and so on, but also to the human cultural milieu as situated in a particular space. Watsuji wrote the book after his 1927–28 journey to study abroad in Europe, and it contains his reflections on how the local cultures of the areas that he were shaped by and shaped their climates. By his own admission, the book was a further extension of Herder’s “Climactic Study of the Human Spirit,” although he granted that Kant was right to regard that work as “the product of the poet’s imagination” (17). Nevertheless, Watsuji aimed not only to make his own account more concrete than Herder’s, but also to address what he saw as a shortcoming in then-contemporary German philosophy. Heidegger’s _Being and Time_ had been published while he was in Germany, but in Watsuji’s estimation, the work was flawed because,

> time not linked with space is not time in the true sense and Heidegger stopped short at this point because his _Dasein_ was the _Dasein_ of the individual only. (v–vi)

Watsuji felt that by contrast his own anthropology was better equipped to understand the problem of time because rather than study “Dasein,” he studied _ningen_ 人間 which is intimated linked to the concept of a spatiotemporal interval (_aida_ 間) and not strictly individual. Since in Heidegger’s philosophy all relationships of _Dasein_ must connect vertically to Being, there is no room from authenticity in horizontal relations with others. Indeed, our relations with others are a source of inauthenticity for Heidegger, since we become absorbed in the They and lose awareness of our being-toward-death. For Watsuji, however, even our temporal relationship with death is subordinate to our spatial relationships with others. When there is the death of an individual, the remaining members of the individual’s community will hold a funeral ceremony. The end of the individual’s life is not the complete annihilation of the individual, but a major transition point that marks the gradual diminution of the individual within the field of human relations over time. <!-- Sakai goes here -->

Watsuji begins _Climate and Culture_ with an exploration of the everyday climatic phenomena of cold. There are two mainstream approaches by which understand the experience of perceiving the cold. In the first, we might say that the cold is something outside of us, which we experience through our senses. The difficulty with this view, as was noted by Berkeley, is that strictly speaking, we do not perceive the cold outside of us, but we perceive _our idea of the cold_, which is inside of us. If the cold is some object that is truly independent of any of our perceptions of it, then what we perceive cannot be the cold but some faint impression created through a mysterious process by that unknowable external entity. Should we then turn to the solution of something like Berkeley’s idealism, we are faced with a new problem. When I am outside, I experience my idea of cold. If you are outside with me, you may experience your idea of cold. But it is impossible for us to experience the _same_ idea of cold, since coldness is the idea of the individual. In other words, under the first model of perception, cold is something external and thus unknowable, and under the second model, the cold is something internal and thus unsharable.

Watsuji rejects both of these models and notes that they both contain the assumption of a sharp subject-object dichotomy. In the externalist view, cold is objective, and under the internalist view, cold is subjective, but in neither view can there be any mixing of what pertains to a subject and what is outside of that subject. To go beyond this subject-object dichotomy, Watsuji advances an earlier form of his anthropology of _ningen_. If we understand individuals as being _only_ individuals and not also at the same time constituents of a community, then we can never understand how it is possible for the cold to be something shared by different persons. If we understand the cold as an object dichotomously opposed to the subject, then we cannot understand how it is possible to feel the cold. Watsuji writes,

> How can we know the independent existence of the cold before we feel cold? It is impossible. It is by feeling cold, that we discover the cold. […] The “feeling” of “feeling the cold” is not a “point” which establishes a relationship directed at the cold, but it is in itself a relationship in virtue of its “feeling” and it is in this relationship that we discover cold. (2)

&nbsp;

> According to this view, the usual distinction between subject and object, or more particularly the distinction between “the cold” and the “I” independently of each other, involves a certain misunderstanding. When we feel cold, we ourselves are already in the coldness of the outside air. That we come into relation with the cold means that we are outside in the cold. In this sense, our state is characterized by “ex-sistere” as Heidegger emphasizes, or, in our term, by “intentionality”. (3)

Watsuji takes from Heidegger’s suggestion of “ex-sistere” or standing outside the self another difficulty in Berkeley’s idealism: how can we explain the continuity of the subject over time? The cold that I experience today is one idea, and the cold that I experienced yesterday is another idea. How can I make the claim that they are the same idea? For that matter, how can I make the claim that I am the same subject, since yesterday’s subject was doing one thing (experiencing yesterday’s cold) and today’s subject is doing another thing (experiencing today’s cold). So, something like Berkeley’s idealism must give rise to Hume’s fragmentation of the self unless we have some mechanism for saying that the self can exist projected through time. For Heidegger because of ex-sistere throughout our lifetime as individuals we are always projected forward to the moment of our deaths, and this self-projection is what makes possible our identity over time.

But for Watsuji, the same sort of standing outside must also exist in the perception of the cold outside of us. It is as though we look outside of us and find the cold and see that it has in it something of us, which is what allows us to take it and bring it inside of us. We go out and find ourselves beyond ourselves. Watsuji offers us another method for understanding this. Suppose that it is not the case that there is first a subject and an object which are independent an opposed to one another, but originally, there is a field of subject-object unity, which is then divided into a subject portion and an object portion. In that case, we should not be surprised that the subject recognizes the object, or that the object seems to contain some quality that makes it possible for it to relate to the subject, since the subject and object were originally one. We might say that the two are holographically mutually containing but perspectivally structured. 

This is the basic nature of Watsuji’s hermeneutic of cleavage. The basic unity of subject-object is first cleaved apart into subject and object and then cleaved together into the subject’s recognition of the object. Hence, the individual has a negative structure. The individual is a denial of the original unity and consciousness is a negation of that negation as the unity is reconstituted in self-awareness of union. Hence those climatic/cultural features of the world that seem to be outside of the subject are in some sense holographically contained within it.

In relation to taste, Watsuji’s philosophy of climate helps us understand how the taste of groups varies not only over time (an observation made by Hume, Hegel, and many others) but also from community to community without implying a lack of refinement in other cultures. In a Hegelian paradigm, we might think of the ancestors of our community as rational individuals but limited in their tastes by what artistic media and objects had historically developed up to that point in time. For Hegelians, it is only in history that a culture develops its aesthetic refinement. However, these Hegelian accounts can only describe other cultures as more or less advanced in coming to embody Absolute Spirit in its progression through history. The path of Absolute Spirit is singular, and history has only one endpoint, though there are many different stragglers along its path. Watsuji gives us a new way of understanding the distinctiveness of other cultures without denying their rationality or dismissing their differences as the product of their “savageness.” Since taste emerges out of the perspectives of the community, it must be grounded in climate as well as history. Cultural differences cannot be deterministically reduced to climate, since climate and culture are mutually dependent, but it does allow us to understand how a different culture can differently embody in aesthetics and civilization its particular climactic niche without therefore being “backwards” in comparison to some other culture. This is also not to suggest that all cultures are equally civilized (cultural relativism), just that there are multiple possible ways in which a culture may progress in embodying the spirit of its time and place at which it may excel or lag behind (cultural pluralism).

###Post-modern multilayering, not sublation
Introducing spatiality was not the only way that Watsuji challenged the Hegelian concept of a linear march of history. In “The Japanese Spirit” (1934)[^] Watsuji proposes that,

[^]: Translations from Dilworth, David A. and Valdo H. Viglielmo with Agustin Jacinto Zavala (Eds.). _Sourcebook for Modern Japanese Philosophy: Selected Documents_. Greenwood Press, 1998. 231–61.

> the special characteristic of Japanese culture lies in the multi-layered accumulation of its various moments. (255)

This “multi-layered accumulation”--in Japanese _jūsōsei_ 重層性--refers to a tendency in Japanese history for various theses and antitheses not to annihilate one another through sublation into a synthesis but to layer on top of one another and persist together simultaneously. By explicating this concept, we can better understand the nature of progress in aesthetics. Watsuji gives several examples of this tendency, such as in clothing styles:

> Not only do we preserve in great part the styles of clothing of three hundred years ago, we also unify within a single life the styles that have been developed along separate lines in the samurai and commoner classes, respectively. The range of Western clothing has then been added as another layer of style on top of these. (256)

As has widely noted, even today traditional forms of Japanese dress such as the _kimono_ have been preserved, not merely as a cultural relic, but as a living choice suitable for certain social situations. This has led to the now ubiquitous cliché of speaking of Japan as the “land where new and old co-exist” and presenting the image of a geisha in traditional attire checking her ultra-modern cellular phone or a bullet train speeding past Mt. Fuji. Although such phrases and images are at this point rather clichéd, the clichés persist because of the underlying truth that Watsuji identified: Japanese aesthetic history is marked not only by progress in creating new styles but also the retention of old styles. As he goes on to explain,

> Moreover, these aesthetic forms do not merely coexist with the newer styles. While they are mutually opposed they are unified in that opposition. (259)

That is to say, when a new style is created, it does not exist solely as a new, unconnected style. It is related to prior styles and brought into a kind of union with them, even if it is the union of opposition. For example, after the development of Noh theater, Bunraku puppet theater also developed in Japan. Where Noh is marked by the concealing of the living human face with a lifeless mask, in puppet theater a lifeless puppet is brought to life through skillful artifice. In a certain sense, puppet theater developed as a negation or inversion of Noh theater, but in spite of this both Noh and puppet theater are able to retain their individuality as styles through their mutual relatedness as negations of one another. He writes,

> The present style of Noh is said to have become fossilized after the Tokugawa period, but this means that the inherent character of Noh was realized through the development of the puppet and Kabuki theaters. (259)

In other words, the essence of the thesis can only be brought forward after it has been negated by its antithesis, without thereby demanding that they both be erased by a synthesis. This is the same pattern that we observe throughout Watsuji’s hermeneutic of cleavage. When unity is negated by division and that division is in turn negated by union, neither of these negations mean the erasure of the earlier phases. Psychic distancing is negated by the ecstatic intoxication of aesthetic experience, but the distancing itself is never eliminated by it. Rather, all aspects of this process exist together in a dynamic multi-layering that grows through historical time in response to climactic conditions.

Watsuji feels that the multi-layered quality of Japanese culture is perhaps unique in the world, and we may criticize his supposition as an example of a scholar being seduced by “the myth of Japanese uniqueness.” On the other hand, it is fair to say that the tendency towards multi-layering had not been as pronounced in the West in the past, and modernist Western theorists themselves denied the ability of layering to hold out against the flow of history, which makes Watsuji’s supposition more understandable. Since Watsuji’s time, however, the post-modern movement has taken place in Western architecture and other arts, and this movement explicitly takes the reappropriation and juxtaposition of different historical styles as its core methodology. “Sampling” is a technique that is now celebrated in many new social phenomena from hip-hop to blogging. The term “post-modern” was originally coined to refer to a new style of architecture that came after the modernist International Style. Whereas the International Style was purely functional and eschewed all ornamentation, post-modern architecture is whimsically eclectic in its designs. From architecture, the post-modern movement then spread out to other areas of culture and going back in time, earlier movements like Pop Art and Dada were celebrated as forerunners of its playful pastiche-making. 

According to Watsuji’s theory of _jūsōsei_, however, Japan has always been post-modern in the sense that it has never been intent on creating a unified narrative of progress as was developed in the West under modernism. Even in the area of religion, Buddhism complemented and redefined Shinto, but it did not eliminate or expunge it. A Hegelian might complain that this merely shows that Japan is outside of the mainstream of the development of Absolute Spirit, since it is not unifying its oppositions in sublation under a synthesis. Watsuji counters that,

> True concrete unity exists by causing each and every contradictory moment to live in its own inherent life. (260)

In other words, unity cannot mean the elimination of the original and the snuffing out of its life, but must mean its flourishing within a new context. This interpretation gives us a way to better understand the post-modern movement, which has (at times rightly) been criticized for its obscurantism and lack of focus. The goal of multi-layering, according to Watsuji is not merely to juxtapose nor even to transgress social boundaries, but to bring into the highest development each of the theses under consideration. Historical theses only come to really live when put into dialogue with later antitheses, even if these antitheses do not result in their sublation. Post-modernism then should aim not just at eclectically collecting and transposing, but at trying to show the core significance of what it gathers through the skillful arranging of things into a meeting point of feeling. 

As previously described, such a meeting point allows for both individual and communal expression. Like a linked verse, post-modern art is at its most aesthetically appealing when it is able to bring its references together with respect for their uniqueness while also bridging the space between them. If the individual is primarily a negation of the subjective field of the public out of which we emerge, then it follows in Watsuji’s thinking that the most powerful expressions of our subjectivity will not be those that aim at producing some positive content but those that aim at negatively realizing the possibilities of the personality. It is for this reason then that in Japanese aesthetics, we find a special sensitivity to the importance of 間 (in this case read as _ma_) for relating elements in such a way as to bring out the interplay of their context. Just as Japan developed historically in a pattern of multi-layering of aesthetic styles, it was natural for the Japanese to become acutely sensitive to the importance of skillfully juxtaposing items within a particular context, and this is exactly the approach that is needed to make the post-modern artists of today maximally useful when crafting aesthetic experiences.

###Locating the genius in an ethos
These considerations of the importance of context in climate and history naturally lead us to reflect on the nature of genius in art. Genius seems to develop within history and redirect its course. Genius seems to begin in a particular climactic location but then cross its bounds and become a global phenomenon. It seems as though the greatest works of art are those that function even beyond their original contexts (think of the Venus de Milo, which was originally a religious artifact) and the greatest artists are those who create new standards for art (think of Picasso). Kant writes that, “_Genius_ is the innate mental predisposition (_ingenium_) _through which_ nature gives the rule to art.”[^] On Kant’s theory, genius is the talent of the individual to create new rules of taste to match our indeterminate concept of beauty, rather than any communal capacity (though it is through this capacity that communal nature speaks). However, if we examine the concept of genius more closely, we find, as Hegel emphasizes, genius must express “the spirit of the times.” For one to paint like Picasso in the Renaissance would not have gotten one far, and to paint like Picasso today is merely to be an imitator.

Based on the foregoing discussion it should be clear that, examined according to Watsuji’s perspective, genius must not be seen as the possession of an individual alone. Rather, we should see it as the ability to crystallize the historical and climactic conditions of the public in a never before seen expression that gives rise to a new space of possibilities to project. Similarly, those great works of art like the Venus de Milo are great because they bring their ideals with them when they travel and instantly reconfigure the cultures into which they are introduced. Genius then should be seen not so much as ability to bring a rule of nature to art as an ability to bring an object out of its context by expanding its context in unexpected new directions. What makes genius so fascinating is not just the individual accomplishment of a particular work or object, but the social achievement of an ability to create or alter the existing ethos of an aesthetic community. Genius is made possible by the pre-condition of a certain historical and climactic culture which it expresses, but genius goes beyond its origin to alter the possibility of future aesthetic experiences.

Hiroshi Nara claims in “Art and Ethics in Watsuji Tetsurō's Philosophy” that Watsuji’s aesthetics leaves art with

> no power to give birth to a new form of art which can challenge the status quo of society, including art. This is because moral laws, which artists must abide by, come from the absolute negation of the autonomous self. And only in this way, that is, by means of emptying the self into the totality of the nation, a person can be one with the nation. For an artist, there is no art that is subversive or produced to fulfill personal emancipation in Watsuji's framework. (113)

Nara is correct to claim that for Watsuji the artist emerges out of the social fabric of morality, but he is wrong to claim that Watsuji thereby suppresses all possibility of genius or historical change. It is precisely as a moralist that Watsuji feels qualified to speak to the ability of art and genius to subvert present art forms and advance history. For Watsuji, local ethics follow the local ethos--the local way of life--according to the patterns described by universal ethics. As the local ethos changes, so too will local ethics. The artist who attempts to fashion an aesthetic experience is naturally limited by the contours of society as it presently exists, since it will be impossible for the artist to facilitate distance and ecstasy in relation to an object if the structure of society does not allow for such the reception of such objects. The paintings of Pollock could never have gained an audience in the salons of the 1850’s, for example, which means they would not have provoked an aesthetic experience for anyone at that time. When society has changed or is changing, however, a great artist is to become aware of the possibilities this creates and express those possibilities in art in such a way that a new category of aesthetic experience opens up. Genius gives the rule to art, but only in those historical and climatic milieux in which the rule can be successfully taken up. The genius of Japanese tea ceremony or flower arranging, for example, were never taken up in the West, but Japanese _ukiyo-e_ woodblock prints directly inspired van Gogh, and through him influenced all Western painting following the post-Impressionist period.

This last example allows us to better understand the phenomenon of persistent aesthetic disagreement. It should be readily apparent from what has already been said that the climatic and historical difference between different communities may inhibit the emergence of shared canons of taste for the different groups. It is not a coincidence, for example, that we often observe opposition to the way of life presupposed by hip-hop music as coinciding with opposition to the music itself. The music is an expression of a form of living and to oppose the one is naturally entangled with opposition of the other. On the other hand, we must also consider more closely the issue of aesthetic disagreements within a community. It may be the case that one individual with an otherwise ordinary background opposes some well regarded figure in the canon of an aesthetic community. This too we can account for on Watsuji’s theory as a natural expression of the fundamental law of humanity. The individual defines herself as an individual by negation of her society. Without some form of opposition to the view of the public, there could be no defined individuals to speak of. What is more, we find that as an isolated opinion such a view will not rise to the level of a sustained disagreement within the aesthetic community; however, should such a view gain wider prevalence it will do so either by splitting the community into two opposed factions with different canons of taste or by causing the evolution of the community’s tastes to better reflect its current forms of life.
