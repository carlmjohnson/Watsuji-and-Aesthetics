Watsuji's no fascist:

Before explaining this distinction in detail, I wish to remark on Sakai's criticism of Watsuji concerning his writings about subjectivity:

> the reader can hardly ignore the fact the author [Watusji] also wished to construct a national narrative in which the identity of the Japanese nation could be constituted by means of the observation of cultural differences between Japan and other regions in the world. Consequently, one could conclude after reading the book that all other climates, cultures, and peoples are viewed as moments cumulatively synthesized toward a final objective: the cultural identity of the Japanese nation. (129)

As Kazuhisa Yoshida notes in "Two Faces of Postmodernism," Sakai's criticism reflect a common tendency among so-called "post-colonial" theorists:

> Cultural typology is always labeled as a political ideology, because it ultimately contributes to the establishment of the political ‘identity’ of a modern nation-state by confining diverse, even miscellaneous, aspects of cultural practices within the assumed uniformity of national character. Therefore, only the intervention of “people as singular beings,” whatever this mean, can rescue culture from such enforced confinement. (219)

In other words, Sakai is critical of Watsuji's attempt to describe the nature of subjectivity because he feels that this attempt is bound up a larger project of defining the nature of the Japanese people and such a project, perhaps inevitably, reinforces colonial prejudices and repressions. What I feel Sakai's criticisms miss is illustrated by this traditional story from the computer science community:

> In the days when Sussman was a novice, Minsky once came to him as he sat hacking at the PDP-6.
> 
> “What are you doing?”, asked Minsky.
> 
> “I am training a randomly wired neural net to play Tic-Tac-Toe” Sussman replied.
> 
> “Why is the net wired randomly?”, asked Minsky.
> 
> “I do not want it to have any preconceptions of how to play”, Sussman said.
> 
> Minsky then shut his eyes.
> 
> “Why do you close your eyes?”, Sussman asked his teacher.
> 
> “So that the room will be empty.”
> 
> At that moment, Sussman was enlightened.[^]

The space in which Watsuji was constructing his Japanese subject was not an empty space. Whatever the faults of how Watsuji constructed it, the alternative was not a social space without preconceptions. The alternative was a space in which the preconceptions were there but random

or worse, there as designated by colonizers or ultra-nationalists. Watsuji attempted to describe the subject as it seemed to him in his experience as Japanese and in contrast to experience of other cultures in both literature and lived experience. As a result, he should hardly be faulted for the attempt, only for his shortfalls. As Yoshida concludes in relation to Sakai's critique:

> just as human nature is *essentially* ubiquitous, so is the diversity of cultural differences that exist in the world. It follows necessarily then that the typological analysis of cultural differences is responsible not so much for exacerbating the existing malaise of nationalism and racism, but, rather, for promoting a better understanding of our common humanity through the comparison of diverse aspects of people’s real cultural praxes.
