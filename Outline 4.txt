Chapter 4.

More thoughts:

- Discovery of individual in Opera?
- Needs more Sōseki?

> Here is a unity gained not by geometrical proportions but by a balancing of forces which appeals to the emotions, a unity of a meeting of spirit. Just as spirits meet between man and man, so do they also meet between moss and stone or even between stone and stone. Every effort is made to avoid the orderly in order to achieve this "meeting of spirit". 192

193 Balance of whitespace in a Japanese painting

> This well-measured balance may well be clear at a single glance, but we can discover no order or rule lying at the root of this delicacy of measure; it was achieved intuitively and it is a "meeting of feeling" that would disappear with the difference of a mere inch. 194

195 Japanese picture scrolls are like music in that there's a build up and let down at can be symphonic, etc. This is unlike atomic paintings in the West.
196 Linked verse does the same thing.

> Each verse in a linked poem has its own independent existence, yet there is a subtle link which unites these so that one existence evolves into another and there is an order which reaches through the whole. 196

> Yet how can such chance create artistic unity? Here again the answer lies in "meeting of feeling," in this case a meeting of the heart. If there is no meeting between the tempers of a gathering of poets, no surpassing linked verse will come of the gathering. While preserving their own individuality, the poets combine their feelings and reveal their individual experience in a symphonic concord of each other's hearts. 196

197 Key is not the intellectual content of the words but the meeting of feeling in pivot words, etc.
197 Noh, tea, and Kabuki all work by meeting of feeling.




This is bigaku proper, not just kansei.
- Ecstasy in the cold (Fūdo)
- We share feelings (RRG)
- An object is a thing that does sonzai
> The supreme value is absolute wholeness; and an aspiration, or upward drive, or eagerness for it, is "goodness." RRG134
- Feeling the sonzai of art objects means intention+ability for art objects

Goals for chapter: 
- basis for judgment in perspective taking/compassion/love
	- T. Lipps: empathy
	- Watsuji on the critic: a lover not a criticizer
	- intention + ability for art (cf. my Deutsche paper)
- explain connection of individual judgments and collective judgment
- shutai over shukan
- Examples from renga

- Should I deal with the cold?

83 Love (in Hegel) as the unity of self-and-other, "love consists of the contradiction that the self acquires itself by abandoning itself."

> Therefore, the natural environment, consisting of such things as mountains and rivers, grasses and trees possesses a "_Thou_" characteristic in its primitive features. 178

> For example, when we love or think fondly of a double row of maple trees, we deal with them as a _Thou_. 178

178 We aren't deal with these trees on the analogy that they had egos too after finding our ego then inferring one in them. Prior to objectification, they were already a Thou for us. 

> In other words, that a subject becomes Thou or He/She and opposes I is generally the first moment in the establishment of an object. WTZ10:188*

Purposiveness vs. Perspective taking as love
	- Meeting point of feeling! is in relation to other audience member, artist, object
	- we also meet in feeling with the thing seen
	- vs. Ability and intention

- 	Sonzai and Seken: the content that the subject experiences.
-	How different are aisthesis and theoria? Both are a vision of the thing in itself. I guess for Plato the difference is that theoria is powered by anamnensis whereas aisthesis is sensual.
-	Plato was pro-Beauty while being anti-aesthesis and anti-art because he thought the Truth of the Being of a thing is its Real Beauty. I think Watsuji can also be taken to be pro-Being-Authentic, but his essences are dynamic not static
-	Defend exploration of aesthetics on the ground that it, like ethics, is a uniquely human activity, therefore it must come from ningen sonzai. 
-	Ends vs. Means, Intrinsic value vs. Instrumental value, is the core of what it is to have Kantian disinterest. The disinterested view just "lets it be." Watsuji is similar, but for him being is doing. How you go about letting it be is active, not contemplative. Think about fanfic and fan-wikis and fannon. These things show that "letting it be" means "letting it do."
	
	Re: also emotion in Japanese verse. The scene "contains" the emotion already. Isn't that absurd though? No, because the containing is about an active engagement of subject and object, not a passive reception of the object by the subject. Hence Watsuji's aesthetics are a re-descriptive of Japanese history not accidentally or insidiously but essentially since re-description is what we do when we do aesthetics. 

##Chapter 4. Reconstructing the Subject of Aesthetics
~~~Subjectivity and objectivity in aesthetic *judgment*
###What is the source of normativity for an aesthetic?
###Aesthetic subject: Ideal observer or authoritative agent?
###Normativity and agenthood in Japanese linked verse

CH. 4: Sharing experiences makes comparing, ranking, art world, etc. possible. In inside of a thing peeks out, just a little.

- Compulsion
 - Conscience
 - Agency
- Agenthood
 - Practical Behavior Affiliation defines man as a collection of choices the agent makes
- Normativity comes from return = Being. Human being is dynamic not static, but being is still from the Good.

###Subjectivity and objectivity in aesthetic judgment
-	When I say, “This ice cream is delicious,” am I telling you about the ice cream or about me?
	Plausibly, it could be either depending on circumstances. Imagine I’m picking out ice cream for my birthday party. In that case, I want ice cream that suits me. On the other hand, suppose I am picking out ice cream for someone else’s birthday party. In that case, I am guessing what the birthday boy and guests will like (Which is a fact about the ice cream somehow? It has the property of BEING LIKABLE??).
-	Trust as ground of ordinary truth
-	Trust and truth apt-ness
-	Truth value of aesthetic judgments vs. Kant

-	Defend self from the obvious problem that Watsuji hates observers? Or wait for chapter four…

-	Does the “mindfulness” of washing the floor fit my scheme?

-	Is comedy subjective or objective?

-	Love for Aristophanes in the Symposium is love of one’s other half, that is another bit of oneself. 
Watsuji seems to be similar, since he also sees Good as one’s own good due to the interconnection of selves.

-	Hershock: You can tell if you’ve found the appropriate because the jazz band keeps on swingin’ in the style of an infinite goal.

-	What is the purpose of criticism? Is it just “understanding” art? To allow for deeper experiences? Or is it to kick art in a new direction? (Cf. Watsuji on “understanding” as the new goal brought by hermeneutics.)

- Job of the critic is to love good stuff, praise beauty, while be sensitive to ugliness. WTZ 7:187--8
-	Gustatory taste as culturally determined? Or maybe this is for four?

-	Hon'i vs. shii: Has to be here, to explain why hon'i are normative and how the subject is a field.

-	McCarthy quotes Kasulis as talking about a gloomy locker room, which strikes me as a good example.

-	Home theater system vs. a movie theater vs. a real theatre.

-	Recall Stan Lee’s greatest invention was the illusion of a community of comic book artists (a “scene”)
	Re: Hip hop music, chiptunes, etc.

-	Remember the great Punk Cycle: Rebel ⇄ Sell out. This is very Watsujian.

-	At 424c of Republic, Plato assumes that a change of music will (signal? cause?) a change of the polis.
	Does Watsuji have similar assumptions? (Yeah, probably.) Is it a cause or an effect?

-	Uniforms vs. fashion as imposed collectivity vs. intrinsic. You can not wear a uniform, but you can’t not have a fashion-style. While wearing a uniform we feel extra bad about betraying our duties. Why? Somaticity, probably.
