###Aesthetic subject: Ideal observer or authoritative agent?
###Normativity and agenthood in Japanese linked verse

CH. 4: Sharing experiences makes comparing, ranking, art world, etc. possible. In inside of a thing peeks out, just a little.

- Compulsion
 - Conscience
 - Agency
- Agenthood
 - Practical Behavior Affiliation defines man as a collection of choices the agent makes
- Normativity comes from return = Being. Human being is dynamic not static, but being is still from the Good.

###Subjectivity and objectivity in aesthetic judgment
-	When I say, “This ice cream is delicious,” am I telling you about the ice cream or about me?
	Plausibly, it could be either depending on circumstances. Imagine I’m picking out ice cream for my birthday party. In that case, I want ice cream that suits me. On the other hand, suppose I am picking out ice cream for someone else’s birthday party. In that case, I am guessing what the birthday boy and guests will like (Which is a fact about the ice cream somehow? It has the property of BEING LIKABLE??).
-	Trust as ground of ordinary truth
-	Trust and truth apt-ness
-	Truth value of aesthetic judgments vs. Kant

-	Defend self from the obvious problem that Watsuji hates observers? Or wait for chapter four…

-	Does the “mindfulness” of washing the floor fit my scheme?

-	Is comedy subjective or objective?

-	Love for Aristophanes in the Symposium is love of one’s other half, that is another bit of oneself. 
Watsuji seems to be similar, since he also sees Good as one’s own good due to the interconnection of selves.

-	Hershock: You can tell if you’ve found the appropriate because the jazz band keeps on swingin’ in the style of an infinite goal.

-	What is the purpose of criticism? Is it just “understanding” art? To allow for deeper experiences? Or is it to kick art in a new direction? (Cf. Watsuji on “understanding” as the new goal brought by hermeneutics.)

- Job of the critic is to love good stuff, praise beauty, while be sensitive to ugliness. WTZ 7:187--8
-	Gustatory taste as culturally determined? Or maybe this is for four?

-	Hon'i vs. shii: Has to be here, to explain why hon'i are normative and how the subject is a field.

-	McCarthy quotes Kasulis as talking about a gloomy locker room, which strikes me as a good example.

-	Home theater system vs. a movie theater vs. a real theatre.

-	Recall Stan Lee’s greatest invention was the illusion of a community of comic book artists (a “scene”)
	Re: Hip hop music, chiptunes, etc.

-	Remember the great Punk Cycle: Rebel ⇄ Sell out. This is very Watsujian.

-	At 424c of Republic, Plato assumes that a change of music will (signal? cause?) a change of the polis.
	Does Watsuji have similar assumptions? (Yeah, probably.) Is it a cause or an effect?

-	Uniforms vs. fashion as imposed collectivity vs. intrinsic. You can not wear a uniform, but you can’t not have a fashion-style. While wearing a uniform we feel extra bad about betraying our duties. Why? Somaticity, probably.
