###Aesthetic Contexts
In the last chapter, we saw how communities of taste emerge from individual aesthetic judgments and vice-versa how individual aesthetic judgments emerge from communities of taste.  Our understanding of both judgments and tastes rests on our understanding of the construction of aesthetic subject and object in lived experience. Now that we have explored that process of construction, the next step in the hermeneutic method detailed in chapter two is _hakai_ [破壊][ja]---"destruction" or "deconstruction." Hermeneutic destruction uses our understanding of specific cultures to penetrate deeper into the basis of culture in general. 

The aspect of aesthetics that I wish to deconstruct is the nature of aesthetic agreement and disagreement. On the one hand, we observe communities of aesthetic agreement form within particular cultures around the world. On the other hand, aesthetic agreement appears to have limitations not possessed by other disciplines. In science, for example, (ideally) cultures around the world and across time converge in agreement about certain judgments. The heliocentric model is now a globally entrenched truth, although our contemporary understanding of the solar system goes beyond either Copernicus or Kepler. The same can be said of Newton's gravity, in spite of its being superseded in certain respects by the Einsteinian model. In Hegelian and pragmatic theories of science, scientific truth *just is* this tendency of agreement to become deeper and wider as the historical dialectic advances. In aesthetics, however, we see nothing quite so linear as scientific progress. While clearly later artists in a tradition pick up certain themes in early works and attempt to develop them in their own works, at the same time, later artists are not so much agreeing with earlier aesthetic judgments as exploring new aesthetic spaces opened up by their forebears. Furthermore, although the art scene has become increasingly global in recent centuries, it nevertheless remains the case that something like distinctive national styles are a persistent facet of aesthetic life. Styles cross over from one culture to another, but in so crossing, they are transformed into something that fits better with the local milieu.

In this chapter, I want to get a better handle on the limits of aesthetic agreement in two aspects, temporal and spatial. Towards that end, I will take up "art" as a topic for examination. A complete theory of art is out of the scope of this work, but for our purposes, there are three questions to be addressed. First, how is that particular tastes and judgments come together to create an art scene? Second, how does art develop over time? Is there such a thing as progress in aesthetic history? Third, why does art vary from place to place? Does milieu play an important role in our aesthetic self-understanding? Finally, I will conclude the chapter by illustrating my conclusions with examples taken from Japanese tea ceremony. 

###Art and the limits of aesthetic agreement
####The many theories of art
The phenomenon of artistic scenes shows clearly the extent of aesthetic agreement and the inevitability of aesthetic disagreement. Artistic scenes exist because groups of people make similar aesthetic judgments as part of a community of taste. Nevertheless, no artistic scene has been able to establish more than a temporary and local hegemony. Even the world famous _Mona Lisa_ was largely ignored from the time of its creation until the advent of mass reproduction in the late nineteenth century. Its fame is just as rooted in historical conditions as any other artwork.

It is a philosopher’s delusion to think that behind our jumbled ordinary intuitions there must stand a single unified and determinative definition for the concept in question. Surely, "art" is among those terms for which a singular definition is particularly ill-met. Still, looking at how various theories of art are used, it is clear that the definition of art is at its most contested when the matter of prestige is on the line. Sometimes a discipline will claim the mantle of “art” in order to raise its prestige, and other times prestige is increased by rejecting the title of art and taking up the title of “science.”† The public fascination surrounding the question of “what is art?” turns on precisely this issue. Besides a basic confusion of “art” and “good art,” the debate reflects the fact that there is a public norm which holds that art is an unconditioned good. As such, for anyone to claim the title of art is necessarily for that individual to demand a certain level of public approbation. On the other hand, “science” is also a term of respect, and so the question “What is science?” has a similar level of purchase with the public. 

† For an example of positioning a discipline relative to art in order to increase its prestige see Donald Knuth's "Computer Programming as Art."

Frequently, certain activities which might otherwise be taken to be arts (for example, quilting, weaving, or glass blowing) are rejected as mere crafts or skilled trades. On the other side of the coin, those who find modern art distasteful express their distaste not by saying that abstract painting is an inferior art but by claiming that it is not an art at all. Such debates are not dissimilar to the debate among school children about whether cheerleading or gymnastics count as “sports” because they are scored by judges. The arguments given, however worthwhile on their own, are of secondary importance to the deeper cause of the debate, which is an attempt to order the values of society in a certain way. To call cheerleading a sport is to place a stereotypically female activity on a plane with masculine activities. So too, to call Jackson Pollock an artist is to put him in a category of secular veneration alongside Michelangelo and da Vinci.

In this section, I will not attempt to define art for myself but examine the broad categories into which theories of art can be placed. I will do so for two reasons. First, different theories of art bring with them different values about what makes art good or bad. By looking at a theory of art, we get a sense for what it is that a group of people are agreeing about when they come to an aesthetic agreement. Second, by showing the great diversity of art theories, I hope to escape the trap of believing that a pet theory which accounts for a few favored examples can be effortless extended into all other forms of art. Aesthetic disagreement so pervades our experience of art that it would be foolish to suppose that because I favor art of a certain kind, therefore properties of that kind of art are normative for all future artists and observers. 

To bring order to what might be a nearly endless task, I will begin by lumping theories of art into four very broad categories: Artist-centric theories, object-centric theories, audience-centric theories, and context-centric theories. As the suffix -centric suggests, my own position is that a truly robust theory of art ought to combine elements from each category. Unfortunately, the elaboration of a truly complete theory of art is a task too broad to attempt here. Nevertheless, there is also something useful about looking at art from a one-sided perspective if only temporarily as a clarifying exercise, since it allows one to focus on what it is that each perspective brings to our overall understanding.

####Artist-centric theories
One seemingly tautologous way of speaking about art is to say that “Art is what artists make.” From that logical starting point, one might suppose that the qualities of the artist are what make some objects works of art and others not. Although logically speaking one might just as easily suppose the reverse---that is the properties of the art that makes the artist---nevertheless, this is a way of thinking about art with broad popular reception that is reinforced through stereotypes like the starving artist or tortured genius. Hence many theories of art focus on the artist as the determinative factor. 

For example, one artist-centric theory might explain that what makes one an artist is a combination of virtuosic technique and painstaking attention to detail. On this basis, purported artworks which are created in a slapdash manner may be eliminated from consideration as possible art objects. This leads to the common objection to certain purported artworks that “a child could have done that.” In other words, the degree to which an object is artistic is related to the skill possessed by its creator.

On the other hand, some theories of art focus on the importance of the “spontaneity” of the artist over mere skill. Such theories describe skill as a quality of the *craftsperson* rather than the artist proper. Related theories of art hold that it is the process of “expression” that makes an act an artistic act. On this set of theories, an artwork is the result of a process by which an artist expresses some strongly felt emotion for others through the art. A great artwork is a kind of mirror reflecting the soul of its creator: the greater the soul, the greater the art. This set of theories eliminates banal but meticulously crafted objects from consideration as art objects on the grounds that such purported artworks fail to express any aspect of the inner life of the artist. Similarly, overtly commercial objects are viewed with suspicion because they were created according to a commercial necessity rather than an individual impulse.

The apotheosis of the artist-centric view must be the famous urinal of Marcel Duchamp (or “R. Mutt”). The first and most famous of Duchamp's series of "readymades," the urinal was an ordinary object with no claim to being art until Duchamp submitted to a gallery for exhibition. For Duchamp, the primordial artistic act is the signing of one's work. This act deems the work finalized and transforms the finished product into art. All that remains is for a gallery to accept the artwork and display it for the public. When Duchamp signed a store-bought urinal, it was transfigured into art, and the fact that the urinal itself was ugly or beautiful was immaterial to its artistic value. 

The clearest shortcoming of such a theory of art is that it utterly neglects the artwork itself, and yet there must be something about the artwork that makes it a topic of concern for parties besides the artist. To remedy this oversight, we will next look at theories of art that focus on the artwork itself.

####Object-centric theories
A conceptually simple way of looking at art is to say that what makes an object† art or non-art is its form. Paint on canvas is a painting, and therefore art. Marble when hewn makes a sculpture, which is art. Rhythmic strumming on a guitar makes a song, which is art. Paper when marked becomes a drawing, hence art. Of course, this view is too simplistic to stand up to much scrutiny, so further restrictions might be added. Perhaps it is not enough for a drawing to be a collection of lines on paper. Perhaps the drawing must also be representational. Adding restrictions of this sort may be conceptually useful within a given medium but there are difficulties in applying it across media. For example, if representationality makes a drawing art, what makes a musical performance art? Is there a hidden sense in which a symphony is representational? One might be able to construct an argument that it is, but in doing so, one loses the simplicity that gave this approach to art its initial appeal.

† For convenience, in this section I will often refer to art "objects" and "object-centric" theories of art. In this case, the term object should be read broadly enough to encompass events. The performance of a play is an art "event," hence also an art "object," although the performance itself is non-material and may not count as an object for some other purposes.

In spite of this, theories of art that focus on the qualities that make for an outstanding art object or art event are quite venerable and can be found in every flourishing human culture.  Around the world, whenever a form of art becomes sufficiently mature, artists and critics naturally begin to create elaborate theories to explain just what qualities a superior work has to separate it from an inferior work. For this reason, there are innumerable different (sometimes conflicting) object-centric views of art. These canons of art tend to flourish with a particular style with a well-definite critical traditional, only to be forgotten as the style itself fades away. We already saw examples in the previous chapters of Zeami and Bashō explaining what made for great theater and meaningful poetry. Cursory examination will discover artistic canons for virtually every other conceivable artistic practice. Once a style emerges, critics and artists set out to explain what makes a work good or bad.

Whichever specific object-centric theory one favors, it is clear that existence of such a vast range of theories casts doubt on the viability any particular one as comprehensive. Such theories are subject to the passing whims of history and milieu. They inevitably enshrine the tastes of their creators. When painters paint colorful canvases, the critics praise vividness; when painters paint subdued canvases, the critics praise restraint. Each theory has too specific of a vision of what a proper form is to extend its domain beyond a limited territory.

One approach to resolving this difficulty is to focus on the art object itself even more strongly, to the exclusion of any generalization about its form. A theorist might claim that art objects *just are* and canons only come along afterwards to try to systematize what cannot be formally encapsulated. Indeed, art objects are often invested with a kind of inexplicable “aura” or historicity. For example, a perfect copy of a Van Gogh painting that is formally identical to the original would not have the same economic value as an original Van Gogh. Furthermore, many would insist that it also properly lacks the same artistic value as the original. There is a certain value possessed by the original art object that no copy can ever possess, no matter how exactly it duplicates the outer form of the original. One might try to explain this value in terms of the artist as the cause of the work. It might be suggested that the difference between the two lies in the fact that the original was created by the artist in an act of expression, whereas the copy was created for merely base commercial reasons. However, such a theory will be unable to explain why another person who happened to have the same character and experiences as Van Gogh would not be able to spontaneously create paintings of identical artistic value.† The object itself has a primitive value apart from its creator but not reducible to its form.

† For a humorous example of an author attempting to replicate the form of a work without replicating the mindset of the original artist, see J. L. Borges’ short story “Pierre Menard, Author of the _Quixote_.”

Pushed too far, this sort of intense focus on the art object is not a theory at all, just the bare assertion that some things *are* art. It would be an art ontology that denies the possibility of an art epistemology. However one could create a hybrid theory combining a formal explanation of the qualities of outstanding art objects with an emphasis on the haecceity of particular objects. Each work has a particularity all its own, which no other work possesses. Certain objects have a kind of artistic sacredness because of their historicity. The goal of artistic practice is to utilize certain formal techniques which bring the haecceity to the fore in the mind of the audience.

But who are the audience and what sort of response ought they to have to the art object? How can we tell when the artist has successfully brought the value of the object to their attention?

####Audience-centric theories
How should art affect its audience? The purpose of art is a topic that has been debated just as extensively as the topic of what art is. Indeed, there is widespread disagreement about whether art can or should have a purpose or not. If art does have a purpose, is it to affect the audience or to relieve the artist of some inner pressure? I will briefly consider a few theories of audience response to art.

One common theory of the purpose of art is that art is for moral instruction. In the strong form of this theory, all art is didactic; it is only that sometimes the artists do not know how their art is instructing others. In a weaker form, good art is art that allows for the proper instruction of others, neutral art is that which has no effect, and bad art is that which leads to corruption. Although this family of theories may seem quite vulgar to aesthetes, it finds backing from such well-respected sources as Leo Tolstoy and Plato. Tolstoy in _What is Art?_ explains that the activity of art is based on the “capacity of man to receive another man's expression of feeling and experience those feelings himself” (121) and that as a result “_The stronger the infection the better is the art_, as art, speaking of it now apart from its subject-matter” (228). Great art for Tolstoy is a kind of vector transmitting feelings of unity with God and humankind. Plato in the early books of the _Republic_ has Socrates discuss music and poetry solely as it relates to the education of the auxiliaries and guardians and seems to take this as their purpose.

One possible alternative purpose for art can be seen in the tenth book of the _Republic_ when poetry is banned for its overly broad mimesis of things the poet does not know. Many in the public seem to take mimesis of visual experience to be the defining quality of visual art, and they seem positively offended by the nineteenth and twentieth century trends away from mimesis and towards expression and abstraction. Although mimesis is somewhat mystifying as a purpose for art (why should I want a perfect visual copy of a table rather than a real table that I can really use?), it cannot be denied that art is often utilized for its mimetic abilities and ranked according to its fidelity of mimesis.

Similar to theories of simple mimesis are theories of refined mimesis. In these theories, the purpose of art is not simply to double the world like a mirror but to bring out its most salient aspects for their contemplation by an audience. In chapter three, we looked at Aristotle's theory of catharsis. If Aristotle is right that the function of art is to relieve the emotions of the audience, then perhaps art's essence lies in its ability to so affect the audience. The audience is, as in didactic art, brought to greater understanding of life and their place in the world by engaging with art that takes the chaos of raw experience and transforms it into something aesthetically appreciable.

Other theories about the purpose of art place less emphasis on the fact that art allows for the aesthetic re-appreciation of the world than the disinterested enjoyment of aesthetic experience itself. These theories are closely connected to theories of “art for art’s sake.” Disinterested enjoyment is taken to be different from mere pleasure but nevertheless good for its own sake without any need for further instrumental value. The appreciation for the world gained by aesthetic experience may or may not lead to any difference in one’s behavior or activity in the world, but the experience itself is nevertheless of value. Art objects, for these theories, are any objects which assist in the inducing of aesthetic experiences in some audience.

One difficulty for theories of audience response is that two observers may have different experiences when faced with the same object or situation. Theories about the “ideal observer” attempt to circumvent this shortcoming by describing what sort of observer is best positioned to have the right kind of aesthetic experience. Such theories can be further combined with earlier theories of didactic art by postulating that the enculturation of the individual so as to be able to have a certain kind of aesthetic experience is best spurred on by prior exposure to other art objects in a certain progression in a manner similar to moral education. Theories of the ideal observer can be further combined with larger moral, political, or religious ideals in order to describe the sort of individual who, it is hoped, will be the product of a proper aesthetic education. Thus, even though both theories of the ideal observer and theories of art for art’s sake emphasize the importance of the aesthetic experience of the audience, these two categories of theories may be strongly opposed to one another, since ideal observer theories describe the creation of ideal observers as the purpose for which art exists.

To talk about "ideal" observers necessarily draws us away from a discussion of the audience themselves and into a discussion of what makes an audience ideal. That is, the discussion turns away from the audience and becomes ethical in that it discusses the broader social sphere in which the audience is situated.

####Context-centric theories
Theories of art that focus on the artist, the object, and the audience were long thought to exhaust the possibilities for how to think about art, but in the twentieth-century a new approach to art emerged that looked not at any one aspect of this triangle in isolation, but the context out of which the three emerge. These are the context-centric theories of art.

A glib way of encapsulating the family of context-centric theories of art is that, "the gallery changes a painting into art." What makes something an artwork or not is not so much a function of its origin in the activity of some artist, other properties of the object, or even how it is received by its audience as it is the context as a whole.

For example, let us return to Duchamp's urinal. Duchamp's theory seems to have been that his signature transformed the urinal into art. On the other hand, one might equally well contend that what was important about the urinal was less Duchamp's signature than its eventual admission by the gallery. It is the place that makes the art. The original place of Duchamp’s urinal was, of course, the restroom. Nevertheless, after having been selected by an artist and accepted by a curator, its new place is the gallery.

Since the distant past, cathedrals, temples, and so on have been used as mechanisms for ripping people out of the context of everyday life in which we all have certain aims and desires and putting us into a new context in which our former selves are lost in the ecstasy of the supermundane. In ordinary life, I may seek to outcompete my neighbor in various respects, but within the religious realm we come to see one another as brothers. According to context-centric theories of art, the gallery is a place that inherits the social role of the temple in the same way that secular theater inherits the role of the religious rite. In these cases, what was originally a *divine* ecstasy is secularized into a communal aesthetic experience. A theory of art as the inheritor of the place of civil religion will point out that cult objects are also thought to have a literal aura in virtue of their position in a sacred place.† Artists on this theory are kind of literal priesthood who have the ability to transubstantiate things from being vulgar objects to being art objects merely by introducing them to the gallery space in the proper way. Once so installed, ordinary people will make pilgrimages from great distances in order to have their lives improved by contact (usually only visual contact) with the set-apart objects.

† Cf. Matthew 23:17, in which Jesus rhetorically asks, “for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that hath sanctified the gold?” It is clear that Jesus sees the sacredness of the temple as a place lending sacredness to the contents of the temple.

The theory that the gallery historically inherits the place of the temple accounts for many of the more romantic or grandiose sentiments that are attached to art, but it fails to account for who the artists and art critics are and what activity unites them. If they are a priesthood of some sort, they must have set of dogmas and rituals that give them common purpose and make them a secular priesthood of art and not something else. Let us look at a few specific context-centric theories to see how they describe this role of art.

One widely received context-centric theory of art in the twentieth century is Arthur Danto’s “Artworld” theory. On this theory, artists select works (some commenters use the term “baptize”) and submit them to relevant individuals in the Artworld for consideration. If they approve of an object, then it becomes art. If they do not, it remains what it is. The topic of conversation that sets the Artworld apart from other groups of human beings is “aesthetic predicates.” The Artworld considers the aesthetic experience of the object that is possible when certain formal properties (in the broad sense of formal) are taken into account and progresses by developing new and more interesting predicates as time goes on. Understanding an art object means understanding the aesthetic experience the object would provoke in its intended Artworld and in the Artworld as it stands today. When the object’s place in the Artworld is grasped, the object is known.

Martin Heidegger also offered his own context-centric theory of art. "The Origin of the Work of Art" (1936) is a wide-ranging examination of the relationships between terms, particularly artist and work, world and and earth, truth and concealment. In his usual style, Heidegger constructs a framework that sheds light on a number of aspects of being and Being, but I wish only to highlight his thinking on the place of art. Heidegger begins by looking at the relationship between artist and work:

> On the usual view, the work arises out of and by means of the activity of the artist. But by what and whence is the artist what he is? By the work… (143)

In other word, making an artwork is what makes one an artist, but art works are made by artists. The two are mutually co-arising. This is similar to Watsuji's analysis of the parent-child relationship and the author-reader relationship in _The Study of Ethics_ (WTZ 10:58--9, 51--5). Just as Watsuji explains the mutuality of parent-child and author-reader by appealing to the persisting relationship or _aidagara_ [間柄][ja] in which they arise, so too Heidegger looks for a context existing between artist and work:

> The artist is the origin of the work. The work is the origin of the artist. Neither is without the other. Nevertheless, neither is the sole support of the other. In themselves and in their interrelations artist and work *are* each of them by virtue of a third thing which is prior to both, namely, that which also gives artist and work of their names---art. (143)

In this case, "art" plays for Heidegger the role that _aidagara_ plays in Watsuji's ethical thinking. But what is art? For Heidegger, art is a means by which a "world" comes into view. In art, a work becomes so imbued with its context that it reveals itself not just as a thing with a particular purpose as equipment (an instrument for use towards a goal) but as a rift revealing the world from which it came. Heidegger writes that,

> Towering up within itself, the work opens up a *world* and keeps it abidingly in force. (169)

Because a work is so revealing of its origin, Heidegger further claims that, "*Beauty is one way in which truth essentially occurs as unconcealment*" (181) and that, "*Art then is a becoming and happening of truth*" (196). The disinterested enjoyment spoken of in aesthetics arises out of the truth of art. Art allows things to be as they are and in doing so they unconceal their world. 

For Heidegger, the "world" is different from the "earth" in that the world is the subjective space in which we together exist, whereas the earth is the ground supporting our existence. He writes that, "The *world worlds*…" (170), in other words, the world continuously creates itself as a substance. We could say in Kantian terms say that the world is the phenomenal realm as created not by static *a priori* reason but by the active life lived by human beings. In our dealings with one another, we construct a world, and an artwork is an artifact that reveals the world we have built together. The world expands in two ways: spatially and temporally. A successful work will reveal both. He explains, "A work, by being a work, makes space for that spaciousness" (170) and "Art is history in the essential sense that it grounds history" (202). History takes the passage of time and imbues it with significance. Because of this, Heidegger feels that artworks can only be understood in terms of the historical context out of which they emerge:

> The origin of the work of art---that is, the origin of both the creators and preservers, which is to say of a people's existence---is art.  This is so because art is in its essence an origin: a distinctive way in which truth comes into being, that is, becomes historical. (202)

There is much more to be said about Heidegger's theory of art, but suffice it to say for now that his is a theory of context. What makes an object art is not so much any specific characteristic in artist, object, or audience as it is the historical and spatial coming together of all of those aspects.

In _Art and Nonart_ (1983), Marcia Eaton also argues for a context-centric theory of art. According to Eaton, "the context of a work of art is essential to its definition" (87). Eaton's work is derived from Danto's and comes from a strongly analytic background (at one point, she digresses into an explanation of the key differences between one-place predicates and two-place predicates), so she does not reference Heidegger directly. Nevertheless, the theory of art Eaton presents is remarkably similar to Heidegger's. She offers the following definition of art:

> x is a work of art if and only if if (1) x is an artifact and (2) x is discussed in such a way that information concerning the history of the production of x directs the viewer's attention to properties which are worth attending to. (99)

Like Heidegger, Eaton explains art in terms of the effect of the context on the interaction between artist, object, and audience. For her, an art object is an artifact (that is, made by artist) and received by an audience that ideally ought to attend to certain properties in the object, but what directs the creative process of the artist and the attention of the audience is not so much a global theory of what makes for a superior or inferior works but the local theories that have emerged in the course of aesthetic history. An artwork brings with it a theory of an ideal observer that it has inherited from history, but at the same time, new artworks create new ideals for future observers. 

####Commonalities in art theories
HERE IS WHERE I PUT A WRAP UP SHOWING THE AESTHETIC AGREEMENT/DISAGREEMENT.∞

###History as temporal context
  - Time
  - There are at least three meanings of “history”.
    - 1. Everything that really happened.
    - 2. The important things that happened.
    - 3. How we recalled or are shaped by the past.
  - Hume on taste x history
  - Jusosei
    - shinmin no michi
    - Hegel (via Bellah via review): Those moments which the spirit appears to have outgrown still belong to it in the depths of its present. Just as it has passed through all its moments in history, so also must it pass through them again in the present.
    - PoMo
- History as double negation: 1. Establish a style 2. Break out!

###Milieu as spatial context
  - Space
    - 空 as 空間性
    - Space as Aida
  - Talk about the book fūdo
    - fūdoki
    - Fūdo as travel literature
  - Seken as time-space bridge? Or save it for the Public/Private discussion of 6?
  - Complaining about cold in Hawaii
  - Humans are unique in that we live in every climate from Antarctica to the Sahara. Most lifeforms either can’t do that or they just go to the other climate directly without having to specifically adapt culturally.
  - Climate has similar issues with “subjectivity” and “objectivity.” Both of them are both psychic and regular.
  - Climate:History::Body:Spirit. In evolution, organisms adapt to and create a climate, changing their bodies as they do so, but as expression of the spirit of progression towards good.
  - For Watsuji, it’s not that the environment is a pool of resources to satisfy our own desires. Rather, the environment is a subjective space out which our desires emerge. Thus, Watsuji’s environmental ethics won’t be overly instrumental, even if he does seem to be anthropocentric.
    - We are interconnected both as agents and as observers. So, fūdo isn’t just a resource pool for us. We want fish because we have fish. We need to understand our “debts” to history and to climate.
    - It's not that Americans loved cars and built suburbs. They built roads and then loved their cars for taking them down those roads.
- Tea!
- Unclassified
  - Ancient Greeks and Easter Islanders are both dead, but it’s better to have been a Greek
  - Fūdo vs. Oku no Hosomichi as travel literature.
  - Takarazuka as a dialectical evolution.
    - All women as a response to all men
  - For Watsuji, even highly subjective phenomena like our gustatory desires arise out of a wider matrix:
- Temp
  - Spatial and temporal aspects of the subject
  - Post-modern multilayering, not sublation
  - Locating the genius in an ethos

###Spatial and temporal aspects of the subject
Although Watsuji has given use picture of the subjective origin of our ethical and aesthetic values, we nevertheless cannot neglect a consideration of the historical, cultural, and environmental forces which construct our subjectivity. In doing so, we can better understand why it is that in aesthetics we find agreement varies both historically and regionally as communities of taste arise and perish in particular parts of the world. This task Watsuji took up in his 1935 work _Climate and Culture_. _Climate and Culture_ is called _Fūdo_ 風土 in Japanese, which means roughly “climate” or “milieu” and is written with the characters wind (風) and soil (土). The title also relates to the _Fūdoki_ 風土記, an eighth century chronicle of the geography, culture, and customs of the provinces of old Japan. The Japanese dictionary _Daijisen_ 大辞泉 defines _fūdo_ as, 

> 1\. Regional weather, soil, topography, and so on.<br />
> <br />
> 2\. The spiritual environment as it affects the form of human cultures. (Translation mine)

In other words, _fūdo_ refers not only to the external conditions of the weather and so on, but also to the human cultural milieu as situated in a particular space. Watsuji wrote the book after his 1927–28 journey to study abroad in Europe, and it contains his reflections on how the local cultures of the areas that he were shaped by and shaped their climates. By his own admission, the book was a further extension of Herder’s “Climactic Study of the Human Spirit,” although he granted that Kant was right to regard that work as “the product of the poet’s imagination” (17). Nevertheless, Watsuji aimed not only to make his own account more concrete than Herder’s, but also to address what he saw as a shortcoming in then-contemporary German philosophy. Heidegger’s _Being and Time_ had been published while he was in Germany, but in Watsuji’s estimation, the work was flawed because,

> time not linked with space is not time in the true sense and Heidegger stopped short at this point because his _Dasein_ was the _Dasein_ of the individual only. (v–vi)

Watsuji felt that by contrast his own anthropology was better equipped to understand the problem of time because rather than study “Dasein,” he studied _ningen_ 人間 which is intimated linked to the concept of a spatiotemporal interval (_aida_ 間) and not strictly individual. Since in Heidegger’s philosophy all relationships of _Dasein_ must connect vertically to Being, there is no room from authenticity in horizontal relations with others. Indeed, our relations with others are a source of inauthenticity for Heidegger, since we become absorbed in the They and lose awareness of our being-toward-death. For Watsuji, however, even our temporal relationship with death is subordinate to our spatial relationships with others. When there is the death of an individual, the remaining members of the individual’s community will hold a funeral ceremony. The end of the individual’s life is not the complete annihilation of the individual, but a major transition point that marks the gradual diminution of the individual within the field of human relations over time. <!-- Sakai goes here -->

Watsuji begins _Climate and Culture_ with an exploration of the everyday climatic phenomena of cold. There are two mainstream approaches by which understand the experience of perceiving the cold. In the first, we might say that the cold is something outside of us, which we experience through our senses. The difficulty with this view, as was noted by Berkeley, is that strictly speaking, we do not perceive the cold outside of us, but we perceive _our idea of the cold_, which is inside of us. If the cold is some object that is truly independent of any of our perceptions of it, then what we perceive cannot be the cold but some faint impression created through a mysterious process by that unknowable external entity. Should we then turn to the solution of something like Berkeley’s idealism, we are faced with a new problem. When I am outside, I experience my idea of cold. If you are outside with me, you may experience your idea of cold. But it is impossible for us to experience the _same_ idea of cold, since coldness is the idea of the individual. In other words, under the first model of perception, cold is something external and thus unknowable, and under the second model, the cold is something internal and thus unsharable.

Watsuji rejects both of these models and notes that they both contain the assumption of a sharp subject-object dichotomy. In the externalist view, cold is objective, and under the internalist view, cold is subjective, but in neither view can there be any mixing of what pertains to a subject and what is outside of that subject. To go beyond this subject-object dichotomy, Watsuji advances an earlier form of his anthropology of _ningen_. If we understand individuals as being _only_ individuals and not also at the same time constituents of a community, then we can never understand how it is possible for the cold to be something shared by different persons. If we understand the cold as an object dichotomously opposed to the subject, then we cannot understand how it is possible to feel the cold. Watsuji writes,

> How can we know the independent existence of the cold before we feel cold? It is impossible. It is by feeling cold, that we discover the cold. […] The “feeling” of “feeling the cold” is not a “point” which establishes a relationship directed at the cold, but it is in itself a relationship in virtue of its “feeling” and it is in this relationship that we discover cold. (2)

&nbsp;

> According to this view, the usual distinction between subject and object, or more particularly the distinction between “the cold” and the “I” independently of each other, involves a certain misunderstanding. When we feel cold, we ourselves are already in the coldness of the outside air. That we come into relation with the cold means that we are outside in the cold. In this sense, our state is characterized by “ex-sistere” as Heidegger emphasizes, or, in our term, by “intentionality”. (3)

Watsuji takes from Heidegger’s suggestion of “ex-sistere” or standing outside the self another difficulty in Berkeley’s idealism: how can we explain the continuity of the subject over time? The cold that I experience today is one idea, and the cold that I experienced yesterday is another idea. How can I make the claim that they are the same idea? For that matter, how can I make the claim that I am the same subject, since yesterday’s subject was doing one thing (experiencing yesterday’s cold) and today’s subject is doing another thing (experiencing today’s cold). So, something like Berkeley’s idealism must give rise to Hume’s fragmentation of the self unless we have some mechanism for saying that the self can exist projected through time. For Heidegger because of ex-sistere throughout our lifetime as individuals we are always projected forward to the moment of our deaths, and this self-projection is what makes possible our identity over time.

But for Watsuji, the same sort of standing outside must also exist in the perception of the cold outside of us. It is as though we look outside of us and find the cold and see that it has in it something of us, which is what allows us to take it and bring it inside of us. We go out and find ourselves beyond ourselves. Watsuji offers us another method for understanding this. Suppose that it is not the case that there is first a subject and an object which are independent an opposed to one another, but originally, there is a field of subject-object unity, which is then divided into a subject portion and an object portion. In that case, we should not be surprised that the subject recognizes the object, or that the object seems to contain some quality that makes it possible for it to relate to the subject, since the subject and object were originally one. We might say that the two are holographically mutually containing but perspectivally structured. 

This is the basic nature of Watsuji’s hermeneutic of cleavage. The basic unity of subject-object is first cleaved apart into subject and object and then cleaved together into the subject’s recognition of the object. Hence, the individual has a negative structure. The individual is a denial of the original unity and consciousness is a negation of that negation as the unity is reconstituted in self-awareness of union. Hence those climatic/cultural features of the world that seem to be outside of the subject are in some sense holographically contained within it.

In relation to taste, Watsuji’s philosophy of climate helps us understand how the taste of groups varies not only over time (an observation made by Hume, Hegel, and many others) but also from community to community without implying a lack of refinement in other cultures. In a Hegelian paradigm, we might think of the ancestors of our community as rational individuals but limited in their tastes by what artistic media and objects had historically developed up to that point in time. For Hegelians, it is only in history that a culture develops its aesthetic refinement. However, these Hegelian accounts can only describe other cultures as more or less advanced in coming to embody Absolute Spirit in its progression through history. The path of Absolute Spirit is singular, and history has only one endpoint, though there are many different stragglers along its path. Watsuji gives us a new way of understanding the distinctiveness of other cultures without denying their rationality or dismissing their differences as the product of their “savageness.” Since taste emerges out of the perspectives of the community, it must be grounded in climate as well as history. Cultural differences cannot be deterministically reduced to climate, since climate and culture are mutually dependent, but it does allow us to understand how a different culture can differently embody in aesthetics and civilization its particular climactic niche without therefore being “backwards” in comparison to some other culture. This is also not to suggest that all cultures are equally civilized (cultural relativism), just that there are multiple possible ways in which a culture may progress in embodying the spirit of its time and place at which it may excel or lag behind (cultural pluralism).

###Post-modern multilayering, not sublation
Introducing spatiality was not the only way that Watsuji challenged the Hegelian concept of a linear march of history. In “The Japanese Spirit” (1934)[^] Watsuji proposes that,

[^]: Translations from Dilworth, David A. and Valdo H. Viglielmo with Agustin Jacinto Zavala (Eds.). _Sourcebook for Modern Japanese Philosophy: Selected Documents_. Greenwood Press, 1998. 231–61.

> the special characteristic of Japanese culture lies in the multi-layered accumulation of its various moments. (255)

This “multi-layered accumulation”--in Japanese _jūsōsei_ 重層性--refers to a tendency in Japanese history for various theses and antitheses not to annihilate one another through sublation into a synthesis but to layer on top of one another and persist together simultaneously. By explicating this concept, we can better understand the nature of progress in aesthetics. Watsuji gives several examples of this tendency, such as in clothing styles:

> Not only do we preserve in great part the styles of clothing of three hundred years ago, we also unify within a single life the styles that have been developed along separate lines in the samurai and commoner classes, respectively. The range of Western clothing has then been added as another layer of style on top of these. (256)

As has widely noted, even today traditional forms of Japanese dress such as the _kimono_ have been preserved, not merely as a cultural relic, but as a living choice suitable for certain social situations. This has led to the now ubiquitous cliché of speaking of Japan as the “land where new and old co-exist” and presenting the image of a geisha in traditional attire checking her ultra-modern cellular phone or a bullet train speeding past Mt. Fuji. Although such phrases and images are at this point rather clichéd, the clichés persist because of the underlying truth that Watsuji identified: Japanese aesthetic history is marked not only by progress in creating new styles but also the retention of old styles. As he goes on to explain,

> Moreover, these aesthetic forms do not merely coexist with the newer styles. While they are mutually opposed they are unified in that opposition. (259)

That is to say, when a new style is created, it does not exist solely as a new, unconnected style. It is related to prior styles and brought into a kind of union with them, even if it is the union of opposition. For example, after the development of Noh theater, Bunraku puppet theater also developed in Japan. Where Noh is marked by the concealing of the living human face with a lifeless mask, in puppet theater a lifeless puppet is brought to life through skillful artifice. In a certain sense, puppet theater developed as a negation or inversion of Noh theater, but in spite of this both Noh and puppet theater are able to retain their individuality as styles through their mutual relatedness as negations of one another. He writes,

> The present style of Noh is said to have become fossilized after the Tokugawa period, but this means that the inherent character of Noh was realized through the development of the puppet and Kabuki theaters. (259)

In other words, the essence of the thesis can only be brought forward after it has been negated by its antithesis, without thereby demanding that they both be erased by a synthesis. This is the same pattern that we observe throughout Watsuji’s hermeneutic of cleavage. When unity is negated by division and that division is in turn negated by union, neither of these negations mean the erasure of the earlier phases. Psychic distancing is negated by the ecstatic intoxication of aesthetic experience, but the distancing itself is never eliminated by it. Rather, all aspects of this process exist together in a dynamic multi-layering that grows through historical time in response to climactic conditions.

Watsuji feels that the multi-layered quality of Japanese culture is perhaps unique in the world, and we may criticize his supposition as an example of a scholar being seduced by “the myth of Japanese uniqueness.” On the other hand, it is fair to say that the tendency towards multi-layering had not been as pronounced in the West in the past, and modernist Western theorists themselves denied the ability of layering to hold out against the flow of history, which makes Watsuji’s supposition more understandable. Since Watsuji’s time, however, the post-modern movement has taken place in Western architecture and other arts, and this movement explicitly takes the reappropriation and juxtaposition of different historical styles as its core methodology. “Sampling” is a technique that is now celebrated in many new social phenomena from hip-hop to blogging. The term “post-modern” was originally coined to refer to a new style of architecture that came after the modernist International Style. Whereas the International Style was purely functional and eschewed all ornamentation, post-modern architecture is whimsically eclectic in its designs. From architecture, the post-modern movement then spread out to other areas of culture and going back in time, earlier movements like Pop Art and Dada were celebrated as forerunners of its playful pastiche-making. 

According to Watsuji’s theory of _jūsōsei_, however, Japan has always been post-modern in the sense that it has never been intent on creating a unified narrative of progress as was developed in the West under modernism. Even in the area of religion, Buddhism complemented and redefined Shinto, but it did not eliminate or expunge it. A Hegelian might complain that this merely shows that Japan is outside of the mainstream of the development of Absolute Spirit, since it is not unifying its oppositions in sublation under a synthesis. Watsuji counters that,

> True concrete unity exists by causing each and every contradictory moment to live in its own inherent life. (260)

In other words, unity cannot mean the elimination of the original and the snuffing out of its life, but must mean its flourishing within a new context. This interpretation gives us a way to better understand the post-modern movement, which has (at times rightly) been criticized for its obscurantism and lack of focus. The goal of multi-layering, according to Watsuji is not merely to juxtapose nor even to transgress social boundaries, but to bring into the highest development each of the theses under consideration. Historical theses only come to really live when put into dialogue with later antitheses, even if these antitheses do not result in their sublation. Post-modernism then should aim not just at eclectically collecting and transposing, but at trying to show the core significance of what it gathers through the skillful arranging of things into a meeting point of feeling. 

As previously described, such a meeting point allows for both individual and communal expression. Like a linked verse, post-modern art is at its most aesthetically appealing when it is able to bring its references together with respect for their uniqueness while also bridging the space between them. If the individual is primarily a negation of the subjective field of the public out of which we emerge, then it follows in Watsuji’s thinking that the most powerful expressions of our subjectivity will not be those that aim at producing some positive content but those that aim at negatively realizing the possibilities of the personality. It is for this reason then that in Japanese aesthetics, we find a special sensitivity to the importance of 間 (in this case read as _ma_) for relating elements in such a way as to bring out the interplay of their context. Just as Japan developed historically in a pattern of multi-layering of aesthetic styles, it was natural for the Japanese to become acutely sensitive to the importance of skillfully juxtaposing items within a particular context, and this is exactly the approach that is needed to make the post-modern artists of today maximally useful when crafting aesthetic experiences.

##Tea ceremony
####The crisis of Japanese aesthetics
Nothing makes clearer the paradoxical volatility and stability of artistic agreement than the crisis of Japanese aesthetics following Japan's opening to the West. The art forms valorized in pre-modern Japan only partially overlapped with those art forms valorized in the modern West. To a Japanese snob of the Edo period (1603--1868), ukiyo-e ([浮世絵][jp]) and kabuki theater ([歌舞伎][ja]) were hopelessly vulgar; landscape paintings and nature paintings were clearly superior to historical paintings; achieving linear perspective was an error, not a goal; statuary was almost exclusively religious; poetry was an invariably social pursuit; the highest forms of art were tea ceremony and flower arranging. Needless to say, these values were nearly completely overturned after Japan was reopened to engagement with the West. In France, artists under the spell of *[Japonisme][fr]* (notably, van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec) were strongly influenced by ukiyo-e rather than "higher" forms of visual art like *sumi-e* ([墨絵][ja]). Too much has been written about the shift to linear perspective in the Renaissance and its greater implications for a shift in patterns of thought to attempt a summary here, but suffice it to say that just as the shift from the reverse perspective of medieval Christian iconography required a shift of mindset in the West, a similar change was necessary in the East in order to move away from the traditional zig-zagging perspective of traditional Asian landscape painting. Similarly, Western statuary had been transformed from religious to secular during the Renaissance as a byproduct of the iconoclasm of earlier eras. Western romantic poetry is ideally written by brooding, lonely geniuses. Tea ceremony and flower arranging have never achieved more than fringe acceptance in the West at best. With so many reversals of value happening at once, a crisis of self-confidence in the arts in Japan was only natural. The sole exception to this pattern is the supposed superiority of landscape and nature painting. However, this is only so because Japanese art arrived in the West at a fortuitous time to accelerate the shift away from historic and occasional paintings to landscapes, still life, and eventually abstract art in part because of the embrace of ukiyo-e in *[Japonisme][fr]*.

If there are any lessons to be gleaned from this cultural clash, it must be the cultural reception of art cannot be separated from the culture at large. When Japan found itself face-to-face with the West politically and technologically, an aesthetic confrontation was sure to follow. At the same time, however, the arts of Japan did not simply collapse in the face of Western pressures. Rather, they adapted to the crisis by developing various potentials that were hidden in the matrix of past artistic choices. For example, Masaoka Shiki took the longstanding trend towards a separation between *renga* [連歌][ja] and individual poems and formalized it by coining the term haiku [俳句][ja] to refer to these poems. While in retrospect the antecedents of this separation are evident in the work of his predecessors, it was pressure from the West that caused Shiki to draw out the distinction. A similar dynamic of Western pressure causing the reevaluation of past artistic values is evident in the _The Book of Tea_ by Okakura Kakuzō

ALSO THIS TEA BOOK WAS PART OF THE "BUSHIDO" TYPE OF REMYTHOLOGIZING OF JAPAN.
