###Aesthetics in context
In the last chapter, we explored _bigaku_ [美学][ja], the study of beautiful things, in two directions: from individual judgments to collective tastes and, vice versa, from tastes to judgments. To do so, it was necessary to delve deeper into the construction of aesthetic subjects and objects. To further our understanding of this process of construction, I next wish to pursue the topic of _geijutsuron_ [芸術論][ja]---theories of art. 

Theories of art are, in a sense, more “objective” than aesthetic experience (which is highly personal) or aesthetic judgment (which is a product of shared subjectivity), but the core of any artistic practice is a set of shared aesthetic agreements which must ground out in the collective subject. How is that particular tastes and judgments come together to create an art scene? In this chapter, we will explore the mechanisms by which art and its subjects are  constructed. A complete definition of art is out of the scope of this work, but I will attempt to address the major frameworks for thinking about art and show the centrality of context to our understanding of art. Next we must look the temporal context of art: How does art develop over time? Is there such a thing as progress in aesthetic history? Then we will look at the spatial context of art: Why does art vary from place to place? Does milieu play an important role in our aesthetic self-understanding? Finally, I will conclude the chapter by illustrating the importance of context to art with examples taken from the crisis of Japanese aesthetics and Japanese tea ceremony. 

###Art and the limits of aesthetic agreement
####The many theories of art
It is a philosopher’s delusion to think that behind our jumbled ordinary intuitions there must stand a single unified and determinative definition for the concept in question. Surely, “art” is among those terms for which a singular definition is particularly ill-met. Still, looking at how various theories of art are used, it is clear that the definition of art is at its most contested when the matter of prestige is on the line. Sometimes a discipline will claim the mantle of “art” in order to raise its prestige, and other times prestige is increased by rejecting the title of art and taking up the title of “science,” hence the “liberal arts” and “social sciences.”† The public fascination surrounding the question of “what is art?” turns on precisely this issue. Besides a basic confusion of “art” and “good art,” the debate reflects the fact that there is a public norm which holds that art is an unconditioned good. As such, for anyone to claim the title of art is necessarily for that individual to demand a certain level of public approbation. On the other hand, “science” is also a term of respect, and so “art” and “science” grapple with one another in the public imagination.†

† For an example of positioning a discipline relative to art in order to increase its prestige see Donald Knuth’s “Computer Programming as Art.”

† Cf. C. P. Snow’s classic, _The Two Cultures and the Scientific Revolution_.

Frequently, certain activities which might otherwise be taken to be arts (for example, quilting, weaving, or glass blowing) are rejected as mere crafts or skilled trades. Similarly, those who find modern art distasteful express their distaste not by saying that abstract painting is an inferior art but by claiming that it is not an art at all. Such debates are not dissimilar to the debate among school children about whether cheerleading or gymnastics count as “sports” because they are scored by judges. The arguments given, however worthwhile on their own, are of secondary importance to the deeper cause of the debate, which is an attempt to order the values of society in a certain way. To call cheerleading a sport is to place a stereotypically female activity on a plane with masculine activities. So too, to call Jackson Pollock an artist is to put him in a category of secular veneration alongside Michelangelo and da Vinci.

I will not attempt to define art for myself but examine the broad categories into which theories of art can be placed. I will do so for two reasons. First, different theories of art bring with them different values about what makes art good or bad. By looking at a theory of art, we get a sense for what it is that a group of people are agreeing about when they come to an aesthetic agreement. Second, by showing the great diversity of art theories, I hope to escape the trap of believing that a pet theory which accounts for a few favored examples can be effortless extended into all other forms of art without thereby losing something valuable. Aesthetic disagreement so pervades our experience of art that it would be foolish to suppose that because I favor art of a certain kind, therefore properties of that kind of art are definitive across all art forms.

To bring order to what might be a nearly endless task, I will begin by lumping theories of art into four very broad categories: Artist-centric theories, object-centric theories, audience-centric theories, and context-centric theories. As the suffix -centric suggests, my own position is that a truly robust theory of art ought to combine elements from each category. Nevertheless, there is also something useful about looking at art from a one-sided perspective if only as a clarifying exercise, since it allows one to focus on what it is that each perspective adds to our overall understanding.

####Artist-centric theories
One seemingly tautologous way of speaking about art is to say that “Art is what artists make.” From that logical starting point, one might suppose that the qualities of the would-be artist are what make some objects works of art and others not. Although logically speaking one might just as easily suppose the reverse---that is the properties of the art that makes the artist---nevertheless, this is a way of thinking about art with broad popular reception that is reinforced through stereotypes like the starving artist and the tortured genius. Hence many theories of art focus on the artist as the determinative factor. 

For example, one artist-centric theory might explain that what makes one an artist is a combination of virtuosic technique and painstaking attention to detail. On this basis, purported artworks which are created in a slapdash manner may be eliminated from consideration as possible art objects. This leads to the common objection to certain purported artworks that “a child could have done that.” In other words, the degree to which an object is artistic is related to the skill possessed by its creator.

On the other hand, some theories of art focus on the importance of the “spontaneity” of the artist over mere skill. Such theories describe skill as a quality of the *craftsperson* rather than the artist proper. Related theories of art hold that it is the process of “expression” that makes an act an artistic act. On this set of theories, an artwork is the result of a process by which an artist expresses some strongly felt emotion for others through the art. A great artwork is a kind of mirror reflecting the soul of its creator: the greater the soul, the greater the art. This set of theories eliminates banal but meticulously crafted objects from consideration as art objects on the grounds that such purported artworks fail to express any aspect of the inner life of the artist. Similarly, overtly commercial objects are viewed with suspicion because they were created according to a commercial necessity rather than an individual impulse.

The apotheosis of the artist-centric view must be the famous urinal of Marcel Duchamp (or “R. Mutt”). The first and most famous of Duchamp’s series of “readymades,” the urinal was an ordinary object with no claim to being art until Duchamp submitted to a gallery for exhibition under the title _Fountain_. For Duchamp, the primordial artistic act is the signing of one’s work. This act deems the work finalized and transforms the finished product into art. In 1917, _The Blind Man_, a Dadaist publication from New York, defended the work writing, “the _Fountain_ was not made by a plumber but by the force of an imagination” (6) and

> Whether Mr. Mutt with his own hands made the fountain or not has no importance. He CHOSE it. He took an ordinary article of life, place it so that its useful significance disappeared under the new title and point of view---created a new thought for that object. (5)

Once an artist has chosen to deem a work final all that remains is for a gallery to accept it and exhibit it to the public. When Duchamp signed a store-bought urinal, it was transfigured into art, and the fact that the urinal itself was ugly or beautiful was immaterial to its artistic value. 

The clearest shortcoming of such a theory of art is that it utterly neglects the artwork itself, and yet there must be something about the artwork that makes it a topic of concern for parties besides the artist. (Bear in mind that Duchamp and the other Dada artists also meant to satirize the self-importance of art with their readymades.) To remedy this oversight, we will next look at the object-centric theories.

####Object-centric theories
A conceptually simple way of looking at art is to say that what makes an object† art or non-art is its form. Paint on canvas is a painting, and therefore art. Marble when hewn makes a sculpture, which is art. Rhythmic strumming on a guitar makes a song, and so is art. Paper when marked becomes a drawing, hence art. Of course, this view is too simplistic to stand up to much scrutiny, so further restrictions might be added. Perhaps it is not enough for a drawing to be a collection of lines on paper. Perhaps the drawing must also be representational. Adding restrictions of this sort may be conceptually useful within a given medium but there are difficulties in applying it across media. For example, if representationality makes a drawing art, what makes a musical performance art? Is there a hidden sense in which a symphony is representational? Some might wish to make the argument that it is, but in doing so, they lose the simplicity that gave this approach to art its initial appeal.

† For convenience, in this section and elsewhere I often refer to art “objects” and “object-centric” theories of art. In this case, the term object should be read broadly enough to encompass events. The performance of a play is an art “event,” hence also an art “object,” although the performance itself is non-material and may not count as an “object” in some other contexts.

In spite of this, theories of art that focus on the qualities that make for an outstanding art object or art event are quite venerable and can be found in every flourishing human culture.  Around the world, whenever a form of art becomes sufficiently mature, artists and critics naturally begin to create elaborate theories to explain just what qualities a superior work has to separate it from an inferior work. For this reason, there are innumerable different (sometimes conflicting) object-centric views of art. These artistic canons tend to flourish for a particular style with a well-definite critical traditional, only to be forgotten as the style itself fades away. We already saw examples in the previous chapters of Zeami and Bashō explaining to their students what made for great theater and meaningful poetry. Further examination will discover artistic canons for virtually every other conceivable artistic practice. Once a style emerges, critics and artists inevitably set out to explain what makes a work good or bad.

Whichever specific object-centric theory one favors, it is clear that existence of such a vast range of theories casts doubt on the viability any particular one as comprehensive. Such theories are subject to the passing whims of history and milieu. They inevitably enshrine the tastes of their creators. When painters paint colorful canvases, the critics praise vividness; when painters paint subdued canvases, the critics praise restraint. Each theory has too specific of a vision of what a proper form is to extend its domain beyond a limited time and territory.

One approach to resolving this difficulty is to focus on the art object itself even more strongly, to the exclusion of any generalization about its form. A theorist might claim that art objects *just are* and canons only come along afterwards to try to systematize what cannot be formally encapsulated. Indeed, art objects are often invested with a kind of inexplicable “aura” or historicity.† For example, a perfect copy of a Van Gogh painting that is formally identical to the original would not have the same economic value as an original Van Gogh. Furthermore, many would insist that it also properly lacks the same artistic value as the original. There is a certain value possessed by the original art object that no copy can ever possess, no matter how exactly it duplicates the outer form of the original. One might try to explain this value in terms of the artist as the cause of the work as in the artist-centric theories. It might be suggested that the difference between the two lies in the fact that the original was created by the artist in an act of expression, whereas the copy was created for merely base commercial reasons. However, such a theory will be unable to explain why another person who happened to have the same character and experiences as Van Gogh would not be able to spontaneously create paintings of identical artistic value.† The object itself has a primitive value apart from its creator but not reducible to its origin or its form.

† Cf. Walter Benjamin’s “The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction,” which claims, “that which withers in the age of mechanical reproduction is the aura of the work of art.”

† For a humorous example of an author attempting to replicate the form of a work without replicating the mindset of the original artist, see J. L. Borges’ short story “Pierre Menard, Author of the _Quixote_.”

Pushed too far, this sort of intense focus on the art object is not a theory at all, just the bare assertion that some things *are* art. It would be an art ontology that denies the possibility of an art epistemology. However one could create a hybrid theory combining a formal explanation of the qualities of outstanding art objects with an emphasis on the haecceity of particular objects. Each work has a particularity all its own, which no other work possesses. Certain objects have a kind of artistic sacredness because of their historicity. The goal of artistic practice is to utilize certain formal techniques which bring the haecceity to the fore in the mind of the audience.

But who are the audience and what sort of response ought they to have to the art object? How can we tell when the artist has successfully brought the value of the object to their attention?

####Audience-centric theories
How should art affect its audience? The purpose of art is a topic that has been debated just as extensively as the topic of what art is. Indeed, there is widespread disagreement about whether art can or should have a purpose or not. If art does have a purpose, is it to affect the audience or to relieve the artist of some inner pressure? Here I will consider a few theories of audience response to art.

One common theory of the purpose of art is that art is for moral instruction.† In the strong form of this theory, all art is didactic; it is only that sometimes the artists do not know how their art is instructing others. In a weaker form, good art is art that allows for the proper instruction of others, neutral art is that which has no effect, and bad art is that which leads to corruption. Although this family of theories may seem quite vulgar to aesthetes, it finds backing from such well-respected sources as Leo Tolstoy and Plato. Tolstoy in _What is Art?_ explains that the activity of art is based on the “capacity of man to receive another man’s expression of feeling and experience those feelings himself” (121) and that as a result “_The stronger the infection the better is the art_, as art, speaking of it now apart from its subject-matter” (228). Great art for Tolstoy is a kind of vector transmitting feelings of unity with God and humankind. Plato in the early books of the _Republic_ has Socrates discuss music and poetry solely as it relates to the education of the auxiliaries and guardians and seems to take this as their purpose.

† Even the movement towards “transgressive” art of the 1980s and 1990s exemplified by Charles Saatchi’s controversial *Sensation* exhibition (London 1997, New York 1999) can also be seen as embodying a kind of didactic theory of art. For the artists and critics who supported this movement, the purpose of art is to shock the sensibilities of ordinary people in order to get them to abandon stifling traditional values.

One possible alternative purpose for art can be seen in the tenth book of the _Republic_ when poetry is banned for its overly broad mimesis of things the poet does not know. Many in the public seem to take mimesis of visual experience to be the defining quality of visual art, and they seem positively offended by the nineteenth and twentieth century trends away from mimesis and towards expression and abstraction. Although mimesis is somewhat mystifying as a purpose for art (why should I want a perfect visual copy of a table rather than a real table that I can really use?), it cannot be denied that art is often utilized for its mimetic abilities and ranked according to its fidelity of mimesis.

Similar to theories of simple mimesis are theories of refined mimesis. In these theories, the purpose of art is not simply to double the world like a mirror but to bring out its most salient aspects for their contemplation by an audience. In chapter three, we looked at Aristotle’s theory of catharsis. If Aristotle is right that the function of art is to relieve the emotions of the audience, then perhaps art’s essence lies in its ability to so affect its audience. The audience is, as in didactic art, brought to greater understanding of life and their place in the world by engaging with art that takes the chaos of raw experience and transforms it into something aesthetically appreciable. This gives art a place within the good life without thereby constricting it to a narrowly instructive role.

Other theories about the purpose of art place less emphasis on the fact that art allows for the aesthetic re-appreciation of the world than the disinterested enjoyment of aesthetic experience itself. These theories are closely connected to theories of “art for art’s sake.” Disinterested enjoyment is taken to be different from mere pleasure but nevertheless good for its own sake without any need for further instrumental value. The appreciation for the world gained by aesthetic experience may or may not lead to any difference in one’s behavior or activity in the world, but the experience itself is nevertheless of value. Art objects, for these theories, are any objects which assist in the inducing of aesthetic experiences in some audience.

One difficulty for theories of audience response is that two observers may have different experiences when faced with the same object or situation. Theories about the “ideal observer” attempt to circumvent this shortcoming by describing what sort of observer is best positioned to have the right kind of aesthetic experience. Such theories can be further combined with earlier theories of didactic art by postulating that the enculturation of the individual so as to be able to have a certain kind of aesthetic experience is best spurred on by prior exposure to other art objects in a certain progression in a manner similar to moral education. Theories of the ideal observer can be further combined with larger moral, political, or religious ideals in order to describe the sort of individual who, it is hoped, will be the product of a proper aesthetic education. Thus, even though both theories of the ideal observer and theories of art for art’s sake emphasize the importance of the aesthetic experience of the audience, these two categories of theories may be strongly opposed to one another, since ideal observer theories describe the creation of ideal observers as the purpose for which art exists and art for art’s sake theories deny the existence of a purpose higher than aesthetic experience itself.

To talk about “ideal” observers necessarily draws us away from a discussion of the audience themselves and into a discussion of what makes an audience ideal. That is, the discussion turns away from the audience and becomes ethical/political in that it discusses the broader social sphere in which the audience is situated.

####Context-centric theories
Theories of art that focus on the artist, the object, or the audience seem to exhaust the possibilities for how to think about art, but in the twentieth-century a new approach to art theory emerged that looked not at any one corner of this triangle in isolation, but drew back to look at the conditions out of which the three emerge. These are the context-centric theories of art.

A glib way of encapsulating the family of context-centric theories of art is that, “art is whatever you find in a museum.” What makes something an artwork or not is not so much a function of its origin in the activity of some artist, other properties of the object, or even how it is received by its audience as it is the context as a whole into which the artwork is received.

For example, let us return to Duchamp’s urinal. Duchamp’s theory seems to have been that it was his signature that transformed the urinal into art. On the other hand, one might equally well contend that what was important about the urinal was less Duchamp’s signature than its eventual admission by a gallery. It is the place that makes the art. The original place of Duchamp’s urinal was, of course, the restroom. Nevertheless, after having been selected by an artist and accepted by a curator, its new place is the museum.

Since the distant past, cathedrals, temples, and so on have been used as mechanisms for ripping us out of the context of everyday life in which we all have certain aims and desires and putting us into a new context in which our former selves are lost in the ecstasy of the supermundane. In ordinary life, I may seek to outcompete my neighbor in various respects, but within the religious realm we come to see one another as siblings. According to context-centric theories of art, the museum is a place that inherits the social role of the temple in the same way that secular theater inherits the role of the religious rite. In these cases, what was originally a *divine* ecstasy is secularized into a communal aesthetic experience. A theory of art as the inheritor of the place of civil religion will point out that cult objects are also thought to have a literal aura in virtue of their position in a sacred place.† The “suchness” or “aura” of a work of art is best explained by its ability to encapsulate its context of creation and reception. Curators on this theory are kind of literal priesthood who have the ability to transubstantiate things from vulgar objects into art objects merely by introducing them to the museum space in the proper way. Once so installed, ordinary people will make pilgrimages from great distances in order to have their lives improved by contact (usually only visual contact) with the set-apart objects.

† Cf. Matthew 23:17, in which Jesus rhetorically asks, “for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that hath sanctified the gold?” It is clear that Jesus sees the sacredness of the temple as a place lending sacredness to the contents of the temple rather than vice versa.

The theory that the gallery historically inherits the place of the temple accounts for many of the more romantic or grandiose sentiments that are attached to art, but it fails to account for who the artists and curators are and what sort of activity unites them. If they are a priesthood of some sort, they must have set of dogmas and rituals that give them common purpose and make them a secular priesthood of art and not of something else. Let us look at a few specific context-centric theories to see how they describe this role of art.

One widely received context-centric theory of art is Arthur Danto’s “Artworld” theory. On this theory, artists select works (some commenters use the term “baptize”) and submit them to relevant individuals in the Artworld for consideration. This may look at first like an audience-centric theory of art. If the Artworld approves of an object, then it becomes art. If it does not, the object remains what it is. The difference is that in Danto’s theory, there is no particular response which the audience is meant to have to an artwork. Rather, the topics of conversation that sets the Artworld apart from other groups of human beings are novel “aesthetic predicates.” The Artworld considers the aesthetic experience of the object that is possible when certain formal properties are taken into account and progresses by developing new and more interesting predicates as time goes on while discarding old predicates which are no longer interesting. Understanding an art object means understanding the aesthetic experience the object would provoke in its intended Artworld and in the Artworld as it stands today. When the object’s place in an Artworld is grasped, the object is known.

Martin Heidegger also offered his own context-centric theory of art. “The Origin of the Work of Art” (1936) is a wide-ranging examination of the relationships between terms, particularly artist and work, world and and earth, truth and concealment. In his usual style, Heidegger constructs a framework that sheds light on a number of aspects of being and Being, but I wish only to highlight his thinking on the place of art. Heidegger begins by looking at the relationship between artist and work:

> On the usual view, the work arises out of and by means of the activity of the artist. But by what and whence is the artist what he is? By the work… (143)

In other words, making an artwork is what makes one an artist, but art works are made by artists. The two are mutually co-arising. This is similar to Watsuji’s analysis of the parent-child relationship and the author-reader relationship in _The Study of Ethics_ (WTZ 10:58--9, 51--5). Just as Watsuji explains the mutuality of parent-child and author-reader by appealing to the persistent relationship or _aidagara_ [間柄][ja] in which they arise, so too Heidegger looks for a context existing between artist and work:

> The artist is the origin of the work. The work is the origin of the artist. Neither is without the other. Nevertheless, neither is the sole support of the other. In themselves and in their interrelations artist and work *are* each of them by virtue of a third thing which is prior to both, namely, that which also gives artist and work of their names---art. (143)

In this case, “art” plays for Heidegger the role that _aidagara_ plays in Watsuji’s ethical thinking. But what is art? For Heidegger, art is a means by which a “world” comes into view. In art, a work becomes so imbued with its context that it reveals itself not just as a thing with a particular purpose as equipment (an instrument for use towards a goal) but as a rift revealing the world from which it came. Heidegger writes that,

> Towering up within itself, the work opens up a *world* and keeps it abidingly in force. (169)

Because a work is so revealing of its origin, Heidegger further claims that, “*Beauty is one way in which truth essentially occurs as unconcealment*” (181) and that, “*Art then is a becoming and happening of truth*” (196). The disinterested enjoyment spoken of in aesthetics arises out of the truth of art. Art allows things to be as they are and in doing so they disclose their world. 

For Heidegger, the “world” is different from the “earth” in that the world is the subjective space in which we together exist, whereas the earth is the ever concealed ground supporting our existence. The world is emphatically not just “a merely imagined framework added by our representation” (170). Instead, he writes, “The *world worlds*…” (170), in other words, the world continuously creates itself as a substance. We could say in Kantian terms say that the world is the phenomenal realm, yet it is created not by static *a priori* reason but by itself in the active life lived by human beings. The earth is that basis of the world which ever recedes from our reach. It is “essentially self-secluding” (173), yet “_The work lets the earth be an earth_” (172), that is shows the earth disinterestedly. In our dealings with one another, we construct a world, and an artwork is an artifact that reveals without self-interest the world we have built together. The world expands in two ways: spatially and temporally. A successful work will reveal both. He explains, “A work, by being a work, makes space for that spaciousness” (170) and “Art is history in the essential sense that it grounds history” (202). History takes the passage of time and imbues it with significance. Because of this, Heidegger feels that artworks can only be understood in terms of the historical context out of which they emerge:

> The origin of the work of art---that is, the origin of both the creators and preservers, which is to say of a people’s existence---is art.  This is so because art is in its essence an origin: a distinctive way in which truth comes into being, that is, becomes historical. (202)

There is much more to be said about Heidegger’s theory of art, but suffice it to say for now that his is a theory of context. What makes an object art is not so much any specific characteristic in artist, object, or audience as it is the historical and spatial coming together of all of those aspects and the subsequent disclosure of being.

In _Art and Nonart_ (1983), Marcia Eaton also argues for a context-centric theory of art. According to Eaton, “the context of a work of art is essential to its definition” (87). Eaton’s work is derived from Danto’s and comes from a strongly analytic background (at one point, she digresses into an explanation of the key differences between one-place predicates and two-place predicates), so she does not reference Heidegger directly. Nevertheless, the theory of art Eaton presents is remarkably similar to his. She offers the following definition of art:

> x is a work of art if and only if if (1) x is an artifact and (2) x is discussed in such a way that information concerning the history of the production of x directs the viewer’s attention to properties which are worth attending to. (99)

Like Heidegger, Eaton explains art in terms of the effect of the context on the interaction between artist, object, and audience. For her, an art object is an artifact (that is, made by artist) and is received by an audience that ideally ought to attend to certain properties in the object, but what directs the creative process of the artist and the attention of the audience is not so much a global theory of what makes for a superior or inferior works but the local theories that have emerged in the course of aesthetic history. An artwork brings with it a theory of an ideal observer that it has inherited from history, but at the same time, new artworks create new ideals for future observers. 

####Commonalities in art theories
The value of having reviewed these different theories of art at some length is that we are now in a position to see the different areas implicitly valorized by the different theories of art. The emergence of artistic-centric theories in the West coincides neatly with the rise of individualism. The Renaissance and Romantic-era had different concepts of the individual and different emphases in their theories of art, but in both cases, it is the work of the artist as individual that is valorized. On the other hand, that artistic communities themselves should gravitate towards object-centric theories in nearly every era is quite appropriate, since such communities must be focused on their work if it is to have any depth of meaning. Audience-response theories on the other hand, inevitably become enmeshed in the question of the public purpose of art, exactly because once we move away from the artist and the art, we are faced with the question of what remains to valorize at all. Is it the effect of art on public morals as didacticism claims? Or is art itself an intrinsic good? Or is it possible for it to be extrinsically useful without that undermining its intrinsic meaning? The context theories are unique in that they tend to do less valorizing of art as compared to examining the mechanisms through which art comes to be valorized. It investigates the historical channels through which communal approbation is carried and attempts to show how this context manages to be contained within an object.

My own greatest sympathizes are with the context-centric theories of art, but the other theories also contain much of value. Without a keen focus on the artist, object, and audience, a context theory can easily become too abstract to be put to use.

###History as temporal context
####History as an aid and hindrance to aesthetic experience of art
The two central aspects of the context of art are its time and place. Let us look first at time. Every work of art is created within history and brings its history forward with it to the present. The history of art is a history of aesthetic agreements made and broken by communities and individuals. 

David Hume notes the sources of difficulty in coming to aesthetic agreement in “Of the Standard of Taste”:

> But notwithstanding all our endeavours to fix a standard of taste, and reconcile the discordant apprehensions of men, there still remain two sources of variation, which are not sufficient indeed to confound all the boundaries of beauty and deformity, but will often serve to produce a difference in the degrees of our approbation or blame. The one is the different humours of particular men; the other, the particular manners and opinions of our age and country.

In other words, differences of aesthetic judgment are due to difference of individual (“humor”), history (“age”), or milieu (“country”). Nevertheless, we should not think of the existence of these differences as something entirely negative. They also help us create the distance needed for aesthetic experience, and this allows us to gain a deeper appreciation of the work in aesthetic judgment than we might otherwise:

> a real genius, the longer his works endure, and the more wide they are spread, the more sincere is the admiration which he meets with. Envy and jealousy have too much place in a narrow circle; and even familiar acquaintance with his person may diminished the applause due to his performances: But when these obstructions are removed, the beauties, which are naturally fitted to excite agreeable sentiments, immediately display their energy; while the world endures, they maintain their authority over the minds of men.

Historical distance aids in our receiving a work in disinterested manner, but at the same time too much distance can also make it difficult to enter into ecstatic intoxication. As Hume reminds us,

> every work of art, in order to produce its due effect on the mind, must be surveyed in a certain point of view, and cannot be fully relished by persons, whose situation, real or imaginary, is not conformable to that required by the performance.

In particular, works that offend our sense of morality are difficult to enjoy aesthetically, since “I cannot, nor is it proper I should, enter into such sentiments; and however I may excuse the poet, on account of the manners of his age, I never can relish the composition.” The history that a work of art brings with itself is both an aid and a hindrance to aesthetic experience, since it transports us out of our usual self and allows us to ecstatically experience another self without losing that original self altogether, but in doing so, it may require a mode of thinking so foreign or repugnant to our own context that identification with it is impossible.

Because of this role played by context in our ability to aesthetically experience a work, the history of art shows both the extent of aesthetic agreement and the inevitability of aesthetic disagreement. Artistic scenes exist because groups of people make similar aesthetic judgments as part of a community of taste. Nevertheless, no artistic scene has been able to establish more than a temporary and local hegemony. Even seemingly timeless works of art vary in their reception from age to age and place to place. The now world famous _Mona Lisa_ was largely ignored between the time of its creation and the advent of mass reproduction in the nineteenth century.† Its fame is just as rooted in contingent historical conditions as any other artwork.

† Some significant historical contributions to the _Mona Lisa_’s fame include its praise in 1874 by Walter Pater (“Leonardo’s masterpiece,” _The Renaissance_, 123), its theft and return in 1911, and its parodying by Duchamp’s _L.H.O.O.Q._ in 1919.

####Art history and the dialectic
When we say that a work of art brings its history with it, what do we mean by history? There are several possible meanings:

* (1) Everything that has really happened.

* (2) The important things that have happened.

* (3) How we are shaped by the important things that happened.

* (4) How we recall the important things that have happened.

* (5) How our recollection of the things that happened has changed over time.

Possibility (5) is now usually referred to as “historiography” (the history of histories) rather than history itself proper. (1) is just another name for time itself. (2) and (3) seem distinct at first, but upon closer examination we may ask, what is it that makes an event in the past important? Surely, its importance comes from its causal efficacy in the present. It is possible for something in the past to be important without our being aware of it, but it is strange to say it could be important without our being affected by it. The distinction between (2) the really important things in the past and (3) our being shaped by the past is less sharp than it may appear at first. However, once we weaken the distinction between (2) and (3) we end up also weakening the distinction between (3) and (4), since one of the key ways in which the past influences the present is as our recollection of the past. (The other way is as an ongoing effect on the environment or space around us.) History should therefore be seen as a way for the past to shows its importance in and for the present. There are more ways to analyze history than this (think of Heidegger’s distinction between "history" and “historicity”), but for our purposes, this definition should be adequate.

When speaking of the importance of history, it is impossible to avoid mentioning Hegel and his theory of dialectical evolution. In _Lectures on the Philosophy of World History_, Hegel affirms that the difference between (3) and (4) is indeed only slight. History that is real history is not just a matter of the past alone but the present as well:

> Those moments which the spirit appears to have outgrown still belong to it in the depths of its present. Just as it has passed through all its moments in history, so also must it pass through them again in the present. (150)

What Hegel means by this is that every individual must recapitulate history for himself or herself. History that fails to make itself present again in this moment fails to be history. It is merely the past.

The history of art certainly behaves like a dialectic in certain respects. When a new thesis emerges, it also results in the creation of a new antithesis that competes with it, but eventually both are superseded by something even newer. For example, the emergence of photography would have been impossible without the *camera obscura* (which in prior centuries had been vital to the creation of true single point perspective), but photography in turn led to the Impressionism and the movement away from visual representationalism and towards abstraction. Development in one direction creates a reaction in the other until finally a resolution is found.

On the other hand, while we do observe communities of aesthetic agreement form within particular cultures around the world, agreement in aesthetics appears to have limitations not possessed by other disciplines. In science, for example, (ideally) cultures around the world and across time converge in agreement about certain facts and theories.† The heliocentric model is now a globally entrenched truth, although our contemporary understanding of the solar system goes beyond either Copernicus or Kepler. The same can be said of Newton’s gravity, in spite of its being superseded in certain respects by the Einsteinian model. In Hegelian and pragmatic theories of science, scientific truth *just is* this tendency of agreement to become deeper and wider as the historical dialectic advances. In aesthetics, however, we see nothing quite so linear as scientific progress. While clearly later artists in a tradition pick up certain themes in early works and attempt to develop them in their own works, at the same time, later artists are not so much agreeing with earlier aesthetic judgments as exploring new aesthetic spaces opened up by their forebears. Particular works may survive from era to era, but the styles which gave rise to those works are eventually discarded. (About these works of genius which survive from era to era and place to place, see the next chapter.)

† This picture of science is of course a simplification, but the point that aesthetics differs quite significantly from this idealization of the scientific method stands.

####Art history as double negation
One way of explaining this difference between the history of art and the history of science is by saying that art history is not a true Hegelian dialectic, but a Watsujian double negation. New styles emerge when individuals assert their identities over and against the group (the first negation); this newly asserted identity is then either embraced or rejected by the group. If it is embraced, the double negation is made complete (the individual has “returned” to the group by the group’s own movement). If it is rejected then the artist must either return to the group by abandoning his or her self-assertion, or remain aloof in aesthetic rebellion (aesthetic badness as the stoppage of further cycles of double negation). Art history is created through this ongoing movement through which human beings constitute themselves as an aesthetic subject.

Think for example of the relationship between rock and roll and punk music. According to the creation myths of punk music, rock was once the music of rebellion, but by the mid-seventies it had grown commercial and decadent, so punk music emerged in order to strip rock back to its rebellious essence. Of course, in time, even punk was commercialized, so that by 1978, punk was already considered to have “sold out” and “died.”† This cycle of rebellion and selling out is perfectly understandable in terms of Watsuji’s theory of double negation. A new style may position itself as counter to society as a whole, but if it has any success, society will absorb it, and in doing so, remove its rebelliousness. Permanent rebelliousness is only possible as a permanent revolution which ever pushes the boundaries of acceptability further and further afield. As Reynolds explains in _Rip It Up and Start Again_,

† See Reynolds, _Rip It Up and Start Again_, xi, et al. for the early death of punk. In 2001, the parody newspaper _The Onion_ mocked the trend towards the taming of punk with the article, “Song About Heroin Used To Advertise Bank.” The article wryly notes that Iggy Pop’s 1977 “Lust for Life” had been used in a television commercial and asks “what better way [to advertise] than to call to mind punk forefather Iggy Pop’s long, terrifying struggle with a near-fatal heroin habit?” (The article is fictional; in reality, “Lust for Life” was used to advertise a Carnival cruise, not a bank.)

> Punk’s simple stance of negation, of being _against_, briefly created unity. But as soon as the question shifted to “What are we actually _for_?” the movement disintegrated and dispersed. (11)

A movement gains traction by positioning itself in opposition to an other, but as the movement of human existence plays out, this opposition breaks down, causing the rebels to be co-opted by the whole.

The advantage of this Watsuji-inspired view of aesthetic history over a traditional Hegelian view is that it allows us to explain aesthetic evolution without presupposing an end to history or a pre-determined direction to the Absolute Spirit. The movement of the double negation in human existence is spontaneous and open-ended. Double negation is what lets human beings be human beings, but it does not restrict us to a single linear path for future development.

The theory of double negation further reveals the meaning of all of those different theories of art just reviewed. A close emphasis on the first negation produces artist-centric theories of art, as one attempts to explain how it was that the artist was able to break away from prior social conventions. On the other hand, as part of the second negation, we turn our eye away from the rebellion of the individual and attempt to comprehend the artwork under an object-centric theory that minimizes the individuality of artist in favor of an appreciation of the work itself and a return to the pre-cleavage suchness of the situation. This allows an answer to the question of “What are we for?” to take hold, if only temporarily. The audience-centric theories fall out of the tendency of this ongoing double negation to create new aesthetic subjects. Because aesthetic experience is an experience that contains within it a potential of being shared with others, it is natural that disinterested enjoyment will be employed by particular interests as a means of creating particular subjects. This occurs not only through the gross method didacticism, but also through the more subtle identification with others that accompanies our feeling of intoxication with the aesthetic object. (Think, for example, of the community building role played by the Dionysian frenzy of ancient Greek theater.) As for context-centric theories, they succeed to the degree that they uncover the mechanisms of human existence at play in art as it moves from context to individual and back to the collective as the embodiment of context. Watsuji’s theory of double negation gives us a lens through which can see past approaches to art more clearly.

> Whatever art form is brought under consideration, the fact that the basic principle of art is unity in variety is no doubt not to be gainsaid. However, whether such unity is obtained only by method and whether balance is only achieved by symmetry and proportion and the like are matters that should indeed be called in question. 179

> theory, after all, merely tags along behind art itself. 179∞


####Post-modernism and Japanese multiplicity
The concept of history contained in Watsuji’s work has a strong influence from Hegel (and Marx), but at the same time, Hegel’s theory of world history also presents a serious challenge for Watsuji because of its Eurocentrism. For Hegel, Asia was where civilization first developed, but since then the continent has stagnated because while “Asia is the continent of sunrise and of origins in general” (_World History_, 190), nevertheless “World history travels from east to west; for Europe is the absolute end of history, just as Asia is its beginning” (197). The national spirit of an Asian nation is condemned to ever be mired at the dawn of civilization and to recapitulate its past, whereas the future of the dialectic belongs to Europe. Though, as we saw, Hegel acknowledged that true history requires the past to live on in the present, he nevertheless discounted its meaning. The ontogenesis of individuals recapitulates the past, but the individual must overcome the past as part of his or her development. Asia is no longer the center stage for human history because it is too tied down by the weight of the past.

To counter this narrative of Asian stagnation, in “The Japanese Spirit” (1934)† Watsuji proposes instead that Japanese culture is marked not by stagnation but by “stratigraphical layering of various moments” (WTZ 4:314). Watsuji coins the term _jūsōsei_ [重層性][ja] or “multiplicity”† to refer to this tendency in Japanese history for various theses and antitheses not to annihilate one another through sublation into a synthesis but to layer on top of one another and persist together simultaneously. If we understanding multiplicity in Japanese history, we can better understand the nature of progress in aesthetics.

† “The Japanese Spirit” is _Nihon Seishin_ [日本精神][ja], WTZ 4:281--321, part of _Study of the History of the Japanese Spirit, Continued_, _Zoku Nihon Seishin-Shi Kenkyū_ [続日本精神史研究][ja] (1935). Translation mine, but compare Dilworth, et al. _Sourcebook for Modern Japanese Philosophy_, 231--61.

† David Dilworth translates _jūsōsei_ [重層性][ja] as “stadiality” (_Cultural Phenomenologist_) or “the stratified or laminated character of Japanese culture” (_Guiding Principles of Interpretation_, 110), and William Lafleur also suggests “multi-leveledness” (_Karma of Words_, 181).

Watsuji gives several examples of this tendency, such as in clothing styles:

> Not only is the style of clothing from three hundred years ago largely preserved [in Japan], even the styles especially developed within the warrior and commoner classes are united in multiplicity as one way of life. The spread of Western clothing adds another layer on top of that. (WTZ 4:315)

As has widely noted, even today traditional forms of Japanese dress such as the kimono have been preserved, not merely as a cultural relic, but as a living choice suitable for certain social situations. This has led to the now ubiquitous cliché of speaking of Japan as the “land where new and old co-exist” and presenting the image of a geisha in traditional attire checking her ultra-modern cellular phone or a bullet train speeding past Mt. Fuji. Although such phrases and images are at this point rather clichéd, the clichés persist because of the underlying truth that Watsuji identified: Japanese aesthetic history is marked not only by progress in creating new styles but also the retention of old styles as something equally alive. As he goes on to explain the old styles 

> are not simply lined up along side the new styles: while mutually opposed, they are unified in that opposition. This is because new styles are created as the negation of old ones, but just for this reason, they end up revitalizing the old. (WTZ 4:319).

That is to say, when a new style is created, it does not exist solely as a new, unconnected style. It is related to prior styles and brought into a kind of union with them, even if it is the union of opposition. For example, after the development of Noh theater, Bunraku puppet theater also developed in Japan. Where Noh is marked by the concealing of the living human face with a lifeless mask, in puppet theater a lifeless puppet is brought to life through skillful artifice. In a certain sense, puppet theater developed as a negation or inversion of Noh theater, but in spite of this both Noh and puppet theater are able to retain their individuality as styles through their mutual relatedness as negations of one another. He writes,

> While the present style of Noh is said to show signs of sclerotization following the Tokugawa era, this just means that the distinctness of Noh has been made self-aware (_jikaku_ [自覚][ja]) through the development of puppet theater and Kabuki. To that extent, we may say its having been overcome is its truly living. (WTZ 4:320)

In other words, the essence of the thesis can only be brought forward after it has been negated by its antithesis, without thereby demanding that they both be erased by a synthesis. Noh was overcome by later artistic styles, but these later styles allow us to better understand retroactively what was distinctive about Noh in the first place. This is the same pattern that we observe throughout Watsuji’s hermeneutic of double negation as cleavage. When unity is negated by division and that division is in turn negated by union, neither of these negations mean the erasure of the earlier phases. The ordinary self is negated by the intoxication of aesthetic experience, but time does not thereby eliminate the ordinary self and its distance from the aesthetic object. Rather, all aspects of this process exist together in a dynamic multiplicity that grows through historical time in response to context.

Watsuji feels that the historical multiplicity of Japanese culture is perhaps unique in the world, and it is fair to criticize this supposition as an example of what Peter Dale has called, “the myth of Japanese uniqueness.” On the other hand, it is also fair to say that the tendency towards historical multiplicity had not been as pronounced in the modern West, and modernist Western theorists themselves tended to deny the ability of layering to hold out against the flow of history, which makes Watsuji’s faulty supposition of Japanese uniqueness in this regard more understandable. Since Watsuji’s time a post-modern movement has taken place in Western architecture and other arts, and this movement explicitly takes the reappropriation and juxtaposition of different historical styles as its core methodology. In other words, multiplicity is now acknowledged as a global phenomenon.

Before it came to be applied to other areas of thought, the use of the term “post-modern” was first popularized by the architect Charles Jencks. He explains in *The Language of Post-Modern Architecture* (1977) that he uses it to refer to a new style of architecture that has come after the modernist International Style. Whereas the International Style was purely functional and eschewed all ornamentation, post-modern architecture is whimsically eclectic in its designs, hence Jencks also describes his work as “radical eclecticism” or “adhocism.” He writes,

> If there is a single direction I prefer, the reader will discover that it is pluralistic: the idea that an architect must master several styles and codes of communication and vary these to suit the particular culture for which he is designing. (7)

Whereas modern architecture sought to rush towards an end to history and bury the past, post-modern architecture gleefully resurrects the symbols of the past as play things for the present. The important thing for an architect to master is the suiting of past styles for the present context of the structure. 

Jencks also notes that Japanese architects in particular seem to be especially proficient at employing this new pluralism in their work. He attributes this to

> the persistence of traditional Japanese culture in all areas, and the absence of a revolutionary avant-garde which establishes its credentials by inverting those of the previous generation. (87)

Again, modernist architecture is ever in search of the antithesis to whatever thesis has just emerged. According to Jencks, because Japanese architects were raised in a culture of multiplicity, they easily took up a new style in which past styles are juxtaposed in creative ways instead of sublating one another.†

† This is not to say that all Japanese architects are post-modern from birth. For example, Jencks dates the death of modernity to the 1972 demolition of the Pruitt-Igoe housing complex, which was designed by Japanese-American modernist architect Minoru Yamasaki in 1951 (9).

After its success in architecture, the post-modern movement spread out to other areas of Western culture and earlier movements like Pop Art and Dada were celebrated retrospectively as forerunners of its playful pastiche-making. According to Watsuji’s theory of multiplicity, however, we may say that Japan has always been post-modern in the sense that it has never been intent on creating a unified narrative of progress as was developed in the West under modernism. Even in the area of religion, Buddhism complemented and redefined Shintō, but it did not eliminate or expunge it. 

A Hegelian might complain that this merely shows that Japan is outside of the mainstream of the development of Absolute Spirit, since it is not unifying its oppositions in sublation under a synthesis. If this were so, however, it would seem impossible that post-modernism could have ever spread in the West. Watsuji counters that,

> Concrete unity exists in the place where every contradictory moment is revitalized in its own distinctive life. (WTZ 4:320)

In other words, unity cannot mean the elimination of the original context and the snuffing out of its life, but must mean its flourishing within a new context. The suchness of each past moment must be preserved and brought back to life in the present moment if a true historical unity is to be created. Hegelianism temporarily obscured this truth in the West, but eventually it re-emerged. This interpretation gives us a way to better understand the post-modern movement, which has been criticized (often rightly) for its obscurantism and lack of focus. The goal of multiplicity, according to Watsuji is not merely to juxtapose nor even to transgress social boundaries, but to bring into the highest development each of the theses under consideration. Historical theses only come to really live when put into dialogue with later antitheses. Post-modernism should aim not just at eclectically collecting and transposing but at trying to show the core significance of what it gathers through the skillful arranging of things into a meeting of vital energy. Post-modern art is at its most aesthetically appealing when it is able to bring its references together with respect for their uniqueness while also bridging the space between them. 

###Milieu as spatial context
####Space, environment, milieu, and emptiness
Now that we have looked at the role played by time in the context of an art work, we need to look at the role played by space as well. As regards time, “history” refers to the way that past moments bear significance even in the present. Regarding space, then, we need to make a similar distinction between space as the object of scientific inquiry and space as a lived aspect of our experience.

That the environment around us has a significant impact on the lives we are able to live ought to go without saying, but too often Western philosophers have neglected the importance of the environment to our self-comprehension within history. A happy exception to this rule is Aldo Leopold and his “land ethic.” As one of the fathers of the current wave of environmental ethicists and deep ecologists, Leopold brought attention to the core constitution of the human being in an especially striking way. In _Sand County Almanac_ (1949), he argues:

> That man is, in fact, only a member of his biotic community is shown by an ecological interpretation of history. Many historical events, hitherto explained solely in terms of human enterprise, were actually biotic interactions between people and land. The characteristics of the land determined the facts quite as potently as the characteristics of the men who lived on it. (205)†

† Cf. Diamond.∞

That is not to say that human agency is wholly insignificant. Human beings are unique as a species in our ability to adapt ourselves for suitability to every climate from the Sahara to the Arctic and recently even to outer space. But the range of expression open to human agency as it develops historically is nevertheless contained within parameters set for it by the natural environment with which it has co-evolved. Like Watsuji, Leopold sees ethics as a matter of finding an accommodation between the group and individual that does justice to the authentic character of each. He claims that all ethics, “rest upon a single premise: that the individual is a member of a community of interdependent parts” (203). In Watsuji’s terms we might say that because my existence as a human being requires the existence of other human beings, it is only right for me to give deference to prerogatives of the community in certain situations and vice-versa for the community to defer to the individual. Leopold takes this core insight and “simply enlarges the boundaries of the community to include soils, waters, plants, and animals, or collectively: the land” (204).

While Watsuji’s environmental ethics are not as broadly considered as Leopold’s, he nevertheless acknowledges that because we lack substantial existence as human beings (that is, we are not independent beings but dependently co-arising), we are radically dependent on the environment around us for our construction as subjects. He attempts to explain this environmental construction of the spatiality of the subject in greater detail in his book _Fūdo_ [風土][ja] (1935, WTZ 8:1--256), which was translated as _Climate and Culture_ by Geoffrey Bownas but which I am following Augustin Berque in translating as _Milieu_.†

† Berque’s “Offspring of Watsuji’s theory of milieu” is (rightly) critical of shortcomings in Bownas’s translation. In particular, Bownas renders both _fūdo_ [風土][ja] and _fūdosei_ [風土性][ja] as “climate.” Berque proposes instead “milieu” and “mediance.” For the sake of intelligibility, I will render them “milieu” and “climaticity,” respectively.

In Japanese, _fūdo_ means roughly “climate” or “milieu” and is written with the characters wind ([風][ja]) and soil ([土][ja]). The Japanese dictionary _Daijisen_ [大辞泉][ja] defines _fūdo_ as,

> 1\. Regional forms of weather, soil, topography, and so on.<br />
> <br />
> 2\. The spiritual environment as it affects the formation of human cultures.†

† Translation mine. Original is “[1. その土地の気候•地味•地勢などのありさま。2. 人間の文化の形成などに影響を及ぼす精神的な環境。][ja]”

The title also relates to the _Fūdoki_ [風土記][ja], an eighth century chronicle of the geography, culture, and customs of the provinces of old Japan. In other words, _fūdo_ refers not only to the external conditions of the weather and so on, but also to the human cultural milieu as situated in a particular space. For our purposes, milieu is the equivalent in space of what history is in time. The significance of space for a subject is as a milieu.

Watsuji wrote the initial form of this book after his 1927--28 journey to study abroad in Europe, and it contains his reflections on how the local cultures of the areas that he were shaped by and shaped their climates. By his own admission, the book is a further extension of the “climatology of the human spirit” that J. G. Herder (1744--1803) undertook, although he also grants that Kant was right to criticize such work as “the product of a poet’s imagination” (WTZ 8:23),† but Watsuji aims not only to make his own account more concrete than Herder’s, but also to address what he saw as a shortcoming in then-contemporary German philosophy. Heidegger’s _Being and Time_ was published while Watsuji was in Germany, and in Watsuji’s estimation, the work was flawed. The trouble is that Heidegger consider being in relation to time but not in relation to space, and “Temporality that does not correspond to spatiality is not yet truly temporality” (WTZ 8:2). Watsuji’s focus on space was no doubt in part just a reaction to his own experiences as a stranger visiting new climates and in part a reaction to the work of his colleague [Nishida][sc] Kitarō on“"place.”† Whatever the reasons for Watsuji’s addressing the issue, there can be no doubt that“"being" without “space” is just as impossible as being without time.

† Watsuji devotes a chapter of the book to explaining Herder’s theory of climate, which unfortunately has not been translated into English (WTZ 8:209--224). Naoki Sakai considers this omission an attempt to cover up the Western antecedents of Watsuji’s work, but the more charitable interpretation is that Bownas felt that the chapter, being mostly historically focused, did not add anything to existing English language scholarship on the German enlightenment. Japanese as Greeks∞

† “Place” in Japanese is _basho_ [場所][ja] and corresponds to Plato’s [χώρα][el] or Aristotle’s [τόπος][el]. Nishida published an article under the title _Basho_ [場所][ja] in June of 1926 in _Tetsugaku Kenkyū_ [哲学研究][ja] vol. 123, crucially just before Watsuji’s journey when both were employed at Kyōto University.

In _Milieu_, Watsuji aims to show not just that space is as important as time, but in many ways, he wants to elevate it over time in our understanding:

> When a human being becomes self-aware (_jikaku_ [自覚][ja]) of the deep root of one's existence and expresses that objectively, that method is limited not only historically but also climactically (_fūdo-teki ni_ [風土的に][ja]). There has not yet been an occurrence of self-awareness of spirit (_seishin_ [精神][ja], ie. _[Geist][de]_) lacking such limitations. Yet, it is precisely these climactic limitations that offer a superior point within which the most sharp self-awareness can be realized. (WTZ 8:119)

In other words, any objectification of experience necessarily losses something and is situated within a time and place, but an expression which takes into account its milieu will better realize itself than a merely historical account. This claim is of a piece with the distinction between the subject as agent (_shutai_ [主体][ja]) and the subject as observer (_shukan_ [主観][ja]) that was explored in the last chapter. Watsuji wants to elevate the practical self over the theoretical self, and the practical self exists out in the world with others. On the other hand, it is because the practical self is with others that Heidegger deemphasized the spatial aspect of human existence in _Being and Time_. Heidegger felt that when one is out with others, one is bound to fall prey to the group and lose one’s authenticity. A resolute focus on time and one’s being-towards-death is the only way to remain true to one’s ownmost possibilities. Watsuji, however, feels that Heidegger’s analysis overlooks the twofold character of human existence:

> Here as well, the twofold character of human existence as finite and infinite becomes clear. Persons (_hito_ [人][ja]) die, their context (_hito no aida_ [人の間][ja]) changes, and yet, without ceasing, persons live while changing towards death, and their context continues. There is an unceasing *continuing* in that *unceasing ending*. What is seen from an individual standpoint as "being-towards-death" is from society's standpoint "being-towards-life.”  (WTZ 8:16)†

† For further criticism of Heidegger’s concept of authenticity by Watsuji, see WTZ 10:226--7. For criticism of Watsuji’s criticism, see Naoki Sakai, _Translation and Subjectivity_, 94--5. For a more balanced take on the issue, see Augustin Berque, "The Question of Space.”

To be sure, whether we agree with Watsuji’s privileging of space over time or not, Watsuji himself acknowledges that the two are intertwined in a way that makes an isolated analysis of one without the other misleading:

> That milieu is not something separate from history is shown plainly in a climactic understanding (_fūdo-teki ni rikai_ [風土的に理解][ja]) of styles of art. (WTZ 8:14)
> 
> In a culture, historicity and climaticity (_fūdosei_ [風土性][ja]) are two sides of the same coin, and one cannot isolate just the one side of it. If there are no historical formations lacking a climactic character, just so there are no climactic phenomena without a historical character. (WTZ 8:119)

&nbsp;

In fact, later in his life Heidegger did attempt to redress the imbalance between considerations of time and space present in _Being and Time_. In “Art and Space” (1969), Heidegger extends his prior contextual theory of art with an examination of the question of space from the point of view of language:

> Let us try to listen to language. Whereof does it speak in the word “space”? Clearing-away (*[Räumen][de]*) is uttered therein. This means: to clear out (*[roden][de]*), to free from wilderness. Clearing-away brings forth the free, the openness for man’s settling and dwelling. (5)

Looking at this clearing-away draws Heidegger into a consideration of the nature of emptiness:

> To empty the collected fruit in a basket means: To prepare for them this place.
>> Emptiness is not nothing. It is also no deficiency. In sculptural embodiment, emptiness plays in the manner of a seeking-projecting instituting of places. (7)

Heidegger’s linguistic examination here resonates not only in German but also in English and Japanese. In English, of course, we “space out” items on a desk by creating room between them. This room is a roominess in which things can be arranged in a context. We ourselves can also “space out” by emptying our minds of any particular content. Space is an emptiness that allows the possibility of future fulfillment. 

The Japanese term for space is even more suggestive: _kūkan_ [空間][ja]. The _kū_ of _kūkan_ is the “emptiness” or “openness” of chapter 2. Written as _suku_ [空く][ja], it becomes a verb meaning “to empty.” In isolation, the _kan_ of _kūkan_ is read as _aida_---the spatiotemporal interval also explained in chapter 2. No doubt, one of Watsuji’s reasons for emphasizing space in _Milieu_ was a desire to show the “emptiness” or “openness” of things. In that sense, _Milieu_ is a response to the early Heidegger that anticipated some of later Heidegger’s insights.

The space around us is not just space. This space creates an environment for our existence. Without it, we could not be, hence we owe to the natural world, just as to other people, an ethical debt. Watsuji launched an investigation into the impact of space on our existence as subjects under the title *Fūdo* or *Milieu*. Watsuji’s investigation was a critique of Heidegger’s one-sided focus on time in _Being and Time_, but the later Heidegger reversed this imbalance by exploring the importance of emptiness for existence, an insight that resonates with the emphasis on emptiness in Buddhist-influenced philosophy.

####Desire, taste, globalization, and hybridity
We already saw in the last chapter some of the ways in which our milieu is responsible for the creation of shared feelings and tastes. My feeling of cold and yours are subjective experiences, and yet we are able to share this experience because we occupy the same milieu. The food that I eat, I eat because it is presented to me from within the context of a particular form of cuisine.

For Watsuji, our environment is not just a pool of resources to satisfy our independently existing desires. As our milieu, the environment is the space of our desire. Our internal feelings are what they in are in virtue of this seemingly external space:

> We find that our existence is extremely rich in such climatic baggage. The clarity of feeling on a clear day, the gloomy feeling during the rainy season, the feeling of life in the buds of spring, the gentle feeling of spring rain, the cool feeling on a summer's morn, the dreadful feeling of a storm---no doubt we could not exhaust such baggage even using all the words for seasonality in haiku. In just this way, our existence becomes climactically prescribed by infinitely rich modes. We are not only shouldered with the past; we also carry our milieux on our backs. (WTZ 8:21)

This being so, we ought not conceive of milieu as something outside of us. The milieu is where you and I find ourselves as individuals. It is a part of us which is extend as “ex-sistere.” Because this milieu is a part of us, we should not conceive of it entirely negative, as something imposed upon us. Watsuji denies determinism about milieux: “I am not saying that milieu is the cause of a culture” (WTZ 8:119). After all, “From the first, our existence has not only this burdened character but also a character of freedom as well” (WTZ 8:21). Through our actions together as human beings in the world, we create milieux for ourselves.

Based on his travels from Japan to Europe, Watsuji divided the world into three basic climatological milieux: monsoon, desert, and meadow. Monsoon climate reigns from India to Japan. In these areas, the weather is so wet and warm that plant life is able to flourish in abundance. The bulk of human interaction with nature takes the form of trying to control its wild fecundity. Arabia and the Levant, on the other hand, are a desert climate. In these areas, the absence of water and the stifling heat sets human beings and nature into a confrontational opposition. The desert must be forced to live through human control. The meadows of Europe are somewhat in between these two extremes. According to Watsuji, nature there is docile enough to be understood rationally. He provides a striking anecdote that shows the effects of these different milieux on their inhabitants. While touring Italy, he found himself struck by the unusual regularity of the trees:

> The shape that the many trees had naturally arranged themselves into was like the precisely regulated one a Japanese gardener would arrange cypresses into. There, one notices also that the branches are spread out in the precisely regulated manner of horticulture. This not only gives us [Japanese] a feeling of artificiality, but because of their precisely regulated and logical shape, it also gives a feeling of outstanding rationality. Yet, if one thinks about it, the reason for its seeming artificial is that we are accustomed to the unregulated appear on the land of our own country. While in our country a precisely regulated shape can only be created through artifice, for the plants, the shape was a *natural* one, and it follows that an unregulated form would be the unnatural one. Hence, one may say that in our country *artificial* goes with *rational*, and in Europe, *natural* and *rational* go together. (WTZ 8:76)

My own feeling is that Watsuji’s speculation here is somewhat prone to fall into the trap of a Herder-like “poet’s imagination,” but nevertheless he gets at something important. How nature impacts our society is sure to influence how our society views nature, and the effect of this interaction is sure to influence our culture in a myriad of ways. Because of this, a truly global aesthetic permeating all space is as unlikely as our finding an end to aesthetic history for all time. Aesthetics must always take on something of the flavor of the milieux in which they flourish.

Watsuji admits that his schema of just three distinctive global milieux is a simplification, but he feels that it is a helpful one:

> It may be that the creative power of art itself is not something to be divided into two or three essences on the basis of differences of "place" that have taken root in the nature of human beings, but to the degree that some "place" concretely appears in the creative power of an artist, it must take the particularity of that "place" for its own character. (WTZ 8:201)

But how applicable is Watsuji’s theory of milieu today? A critic might protest that the process of globalization has resulted in the erasure of the importance of place. The airplane and the internet have made it the case that distance no longer matters. Even from his vantage in the early twentieth century, Watsuji was aware of the ongoing diminishment of place. Still, he feels that even if it is diminished milieu will not disappear entirely as factor in human existence:

> This is all a thing of the past. Today, it seems like the world is becoming one and the stimuli of different cultures is overwhelming the particularity of nature. Nevertheless, the particularity of nature is surely not something that will vanish. Just as much as ever, people, unknowingly and unconsciously, are restricted by it even as they sink their roots into it. (WTZ 8:203--4)

Although we are tempted to look only at the world from the point of view of globalized history, the emergence of the environmental movement in the mid-to-late twentieth century happened just because people became increasingly aware of the importance of the ecosystems around them. The root of this awareness was a series of ecological crises including Rachel Carson’s _Silent Spring_, Love Canal, Chernobyl, the hole in the ozone layer, global climate change, and many others. We are able to create virtual spaces with our technology, but we ignore our milieux at our peril: 

> Ignoring milieu is not how one goes beyond it. It just means remaining within one's climactic limitations without self-awareness (_mujikaku-teki_ [無自覚的][ja]). (WTZ 8:120)

In any event, argues Watsuji, the increasing connection among the places of the world only shows the importance of the differences between them that remain and grow deeper over time:

> This inquiry clearly contains two problems: the problem of art that differs in "time" and art that differs in "place." From the beginning, art that differs in its "place" has also possessed a style internal to itself that differs by "time." The two intertwine closely to prescribe the particularity of a concrete work of art. Now, at a time when all the cultures of the world are in contact with one another and it can seem as if the world is becoming "one place" as in the modern era, it comes to be the case that only the problem of "time" is evident. Yet, it is all the more precisely in the circumstance in which the world seems to be becoming "one place" that it will be even easier to reflect on the questions of why in previous ages the world was divided into significantly different "places," how those differences prescribed forms of art, how deeply those forms of art participated in differences of "place."  (WTZ 8:171--2)

If the present really is a moment of globalization, we need now more than ever to understand the global milieux which are now coming into union with one another. A key question for the future is how the various distinctive milieux of the world will be able to hybridize with one another. Throughout _Milieu_, Watsuji attempts to show that when an idea moves from one milieu to another, it carries the seed of its old milieu with it even as it is transformed by its new one. The particular characteristics of a milieu, he writes,

> are able to transfer to other "places" through historical influence. For example, that the Old Testament, born of the desert way of life, has held Europe under its spell for thousands of years, and that the Koran, coming out of that same desert, has a strong power over India today show that the particularity of a "place" is not an absolute. Nevertheless, one cannot properly understand the Old Testament or the Koran without an understanding of the particularity of desert life. (WTZ 8:201)

When the product of one milieu enters another, both the work and milieu it enters are transformed in novel ways while retaining without erasure the cleavages of the past. If globalization truly is going to be an important aspect of the future of art history, then hybridization will be a necessary aspect of that history. Just as post-modernism emphasizes novel juxtapositions across epochs of time, so too multiculturalism emphasizes the value of juxtaposing regionally rooted cultures in space. Here again, Watsuji was able to anticipate the coming trend in thought:

> If we take it that limitations of milieu create nations (_kokumin_ [国民][ja]) and give them advantages in different areas, then it is precisely on this point that we are also made self-aware (_jikau_ [自覚][ja]) in our own shortcomings and come to be able to learn from one another. It will be in just this manner that we may *go beyond climactic limitations* (_fūdo-teki gentei o koete_ [風土的限定を超えて][ja]) and develop ourself. (WTZ 8:119)

Watsuji saw Japan as a unique world stage for this surmounting of the limitations of milieu. However, we are able to take Watsuji’s theory and remove its nationalist elements in order to reveals its core contribution, which is an appreciation for the suchness of diverse contexts. In relation to taste, Watsuji’s theory of milieu helps us understand how the taste of groups varies not only over time but also from culture to culture without implying a lack of refinement in other cultures. In a Hegelian paradigm, we might think of the ancestors of our community as rational individuals but limited in their tastes by what artistic media and objects had historically developed up to that point in time. For Hegelians, it is only in history that a culture develops its aesthetic refinement. However, these Hegelian accounts can only describe other cultures as more or less advanced in coming to embody Absolute Spirit in its progression through history. The path of Absolute Spirit is singular, and history has only one endpoint, though there are many different stragglers on the one path. Watsuji lends us a new way of understanding the distinctiveness of other cultures without denying their rationality or dismissing their differences as the product of their “savageness.” Since tastes emerges out of the perspectives of the community, they must be grounded in milieu. Cultural differences cannot be deterministically reduced to climate, but it does allow us to understand how a different culture can differently embody in aesthetics and civilization its particular climactic niche without therefore being “backwards” in comparison to some other culture. This is also not to suggest that all cultures are equally civilized (cultural relativism), just that there are multiple possible ways in which a culture may progress in embodying the spirit of its time and place at which it may excel or lag behind (cultural pluralism). The goal of art is to promote excellence through the unification of experience.

##Okakura Kakuzō, _The Book of Tea_, and “Teaism”
####The crisis of Japanese aesthetics
Nothing more clearly illustrates the role of HYBRIDITY∞ in the interaction between history and milieu in art than the crisis of Japanese aesthetics following Japan’s opening to the West. The art forms valorized in pre-modern Japan only partially overlapped with those art forms valorized in the modern West. To a Japanese snob of the Edo period (1603--1868), Ukiyo-e ([浮世絵][jp], mass reproduced prints of “the floating world”) and Kabuki theater ([歌舞伎][ja]) were hopelessly vulgar; landscape paintings and nature paintings were clearly superior to historical paintings; achieving linear perspective was an error, not a goal; statuary was almost exclusively religious; poetry was an invariably social pursuit; the highest forms of art were flower arranging and tea ceremony. Needless to say, these values were nearly completely overturned after Japan was reopened to engagement with the West. In France, artists under the spell of *[Japonisme][fr]* (notably, van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec) were strongly influenced by ukiyo-e rather than “higher” forms of visual art like *sumi-e* ([墨絵][ja]). Too much has been written about the shift to linear perspective in the Renaissance and its greater implications for a shift in patterns of thought to attempt a summary here, but suffice it to say that just as the shift from the reverse perspective of medieval Christian iconography required a shift of mindset in the West, a similar change was necessary in the East in order to move away from the traditional zig-zagging perspective of traditional Asian landscape painting. Similarly, Western statuary had been transformed from religious to secular during the Renaissance as a byproduct of the iconoclasm of earlier eras. Western romantic poetry is ideally written by brooding, lonely geniuses. Tea ceremony and flower arranging have never achieved more than fringe acceptance in the West at best. With so many reversals of value happening at once, a crisis of self-confidence in the arts in Japan was only natural. The sole exception to this pattern is the supposed superiority of landscape and nature painting. However, this is only so because Japanese art arrived in the West at a fortuitous time to accelerate the shift away from historic and occasional paintings to landscapes, still life, and eventually abstract art in part because of the embrace of ukiyo-e in *[Japonisme][fr]*.

If there are any lessons to be gleaned from this cultural clash, it must be the cultural reception of art cannot be separated from the culture at large. When Japan found itself face-to-face with the West politically and technologically, an aesthetic confrontation was sure to follow. At the same time, however, the arts of Japan did not simply collapse in the face of Western pressures. Rather, they adapted to the crisis by developing various potentials that were hidden in the matrix of past artistic choices. For example, Masaoka Shiki took the longstanding trend towards a separation between *renga* [連歌][ja] and individual poems and formalized it by coining the term haiku [俳句][ja] to refer to these poems. While in retrospect the antecedents of this separation are evident in the work of his predecessors, it was pressure from the West that caused Shiki to draw out the distinction explicitly. A similar dynamic of Western pressure causing the reevaluation of past artistic values is evident in the _The Book of Tea_ by Okakura Kakuzō.

	Broseph was a perfect embodiment of his context as country and era.
	OKAKURA WAS A BIT OF A RAKE, BUT HIS SUCCESS SHOWS THAT PLACE ISN’T REPLACEABLE (groan). As Watsuji explained in _Milieu_, culture transforms when it crosses from region to region. Just as the desert religion of Judaism was transformed by the meadow culture of the Greeks into Christianity, so too, his “Teaism” was transformed by Frank Lloyd Wright, who then made the big hotel in Tokyo. The synthesis is endless in its reverberations.
