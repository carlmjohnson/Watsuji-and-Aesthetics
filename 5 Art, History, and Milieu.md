###Aesthetic Contexts
In the last chapter, we saw how communities of taste emerge from individual judgments, and vice-versa, individual judgments emerge from communities of taste. But where do these things come from and where do they go? Ie. How do we deal with the non-covergence of value in art? Science converges. Art mostly doesn't.

###Theories of art

  - Is art a Republic Book II-style intrinsic+extrinsic good? 
  - look at theories of art and conclude that the context cannot be neglected, the rest of the chapter is about context.

####Crisis of East and West
What brings particular focus to the problem of normativity in aesthetic judgment is a little mentioned crisis in Japanese aesthetics. The art forms valorized in pre-modern Japan only partially overlapped with those art forms valorized in the modern West. To an Edo period Japanese snob, Ukiyo-e and kabuki were hopelessly vulgar; landscape paintings and nature paintings were clearly superior to historical paintings; achieving linear perspective was an error, not a goal; statuary was almost exclusively religious; poetry was an invariably social pursuit means of bringing meaning to life; the highest forms of art were tea ceremony and flower arranging. Needless to say, these values were nearly completely overturned after Japan was reopened to engagement with the West. In France, artists under the spell of *[Japonisme][fr]* (notably, van Gogh and Toulouse-Lautrec) were strongly influenced by ukiyo-e rather than "higher" forms of visual art like *sumi-e* ([墨絵][ja]). Too much has been written about the shift to linear perspective in the Renaissance and its greater implications for a shift in patterns of thought to attempt a summary here, but suffice it to say that just as the shift from the reverse perspective of medieval Christian iconography required a shift of mindset in the West, a similar change was necessary in the East in order to move away from the traditional zig-zagging perspective. Similarly, Western statuary had been transformed from religious to secular during the Renaissance as a byproduct of the iconoclasm of earlier eras. Western poetry is ideally written by brooding, lonely geniuses. Tea ceremony and flower arranging have never achieved more than fringe acceptance in the West. Accordingly, a crisis of self-confidence in the arts in Japan was only natural. The sole exception to this pattern is the supposed superiority of landscape and nature painting. However, this is only so because Japanese art arrived in the West at a fortuitous time to accelerate the shift away from historic and occasional paintings to landscapes, still life, and eventually abstract art through the embrace of ukiyo-e in *[Japonisme][fr]*.

If there are any lessons to be gleaned from this cultural clash, it must be the volatility of our aesthetic judgments within the vicissitudes of historical evolutions of art theory and the centrality of location to the reception of art. A theory of shared aesthetic judgments cannot be complete without comment on the relationship between communities of taste and the so-called "Artworld." Accordingly, I will here offer a somewhat lengthy digression considering just some of the possible theories of art.

####Consideration of possible theories of art
To bring order to what might be a nearly endless task, I will begin by lumping theories of art into four very broad categories: Artist-centric theories, object-centric theories, audience-centric theories, and context-centric theories. As the suffix -centric suggests, my own position is that a truly robust theory of art ought to combine elements from each category. Unfortunately, the elaboration of a complete theory of art is a task too broad to attempt here. Nevertheless, there is also something useful about looking at art from a one-sided perspective if only temporarily as a clarifying exercise, since it allows one to focus on what it is that each perspective brings to overall our understanding.

####Artist-centric theories
One seemingly tautologous way of speaking about art is to say that “Art is what artists make.” From that logical starting point, one might suppose that the qualities of the artist are what make some objects works of art and others not. Although logically speaking one might just as easily suppose the reverse---that is the properties of the art that makes the artist---nevertheless, this is a way of thinking about art with broad popular reception that is reinforced through stereotypes like the starving artist or tortured genius. Hence many theories of art focus on the artist as the determinating factor. 

For example, one artist-centric theory might explain that what makes one an artist is a combination of virtuosic technique and painstaking attention to detail. On this basis, purported artworks which are created in a slapdash manner may be eliminated from consideration as possible art objects. This leads to the common objection to certain purported artworks that “a child could have done that.” In other words, the degree to which an object is artistic is related to the skill possessed by its creator.

On the other hand, some theories of art focus on the importance of the “spontaneity” of the artist over mere skill. Such theories describe skill as a quality of the *craftsperson* rather than the artist proper. Related theories of art hold that it is the process of “expression” that makes an act an artistic act. On this set of theories, an artwork is the result of a process by which an artist expresses some strongly felt emotion for others through the art. A great artwork is a kind of mirror reflecting the soul of its creator: the greater the soul, the greater the art. This set of theories eliminates banal but meticulously crafted objects from consideration as art objects on the grounds that such purported artworks fail to express any aspect of the inner life of the artist. Similarly, overtly commercial objects are viewed with suspicion because they were created according to a commercial necessity rather than an individual impulse.

The apotheosis of the artist-centric view must be the famous urinal of Marcel Duchamp (or “R. Mutt”). The first and most famous of Duchamp's series of "readymades," the urinal was an ordinary object with no claim to being art until Duchamp submitted to a gallery for exhibition. For Duchamp, the primordial artistic act is the signing of one's work. This act deems the work finalized and transforms the finished product into art. All that remains is for a gallery to accept the artwork and display it for the public. When Duchamp signed a store-bought urinal, it was transfigured into art, and the fact that the urinal itself was ugly or beautiful was immaterial to its artistic value. 

The clearest shortcoming of such a theory of art is that it utterly neglects the artwork itself, and yet there must be something about the artwork that makes it a topic of concern for parties besides the artist. Next, we will look at theories of art that focus on the artwork itself.

####Object-centric theories
A conceptually simple way of looking at art is to say that what makes an object† art or non-art is its form. Paint on canvas is a painting, and therefore art. Marble when hewn makes a sculpture, which is art. Rhythmic strumming on a guitar makes a song, which is art. Paper when marked becomes a drawing, hence art. Of course, this view is too simplistic to stand up to much scrutiny, so further restrictions might be added. Perhaps it is not enough for a drawing to be a collection of lines on paper. Perhaps the drawing must also be representational. Adding restrictions of this sort may be conceptually useful within a given medium but there are difficulties in applying it across media. For example, if representationality makes a drawing art, what makes a musical performance art? Is there a hidden sense in which a symphony is representational? One might be able to construct an argument that it is, but in doing so, one loses the simplicity that gave this approach to art its initial appeal.

† For convenience, in this section I will often refer to art "objects" and "object-centric" theories of art. In this case, the term object should be read broadly enough to encompass events. The performance of a play is an art "event," hence also an art "object," although the performance itself is non-material and may not count as an object for some other purposes.

In spite of this, theories of art that focus on the qualities that make for an outstanding art object or art event are quite venerable and can be found in every flourishing human culture.  Around the world, whenever a form of art becomes sufficiently mature, artists and critics naturally begin to create elaborate theories to explain just what qualities a superior work has to separate it from an inferior work. For this reason, there are innumerable different (sometimes conflicting) object-centric views of art. These canons of art tend to flourish with a particular style with a well-definite critical traditional, only to be forgotten as the style itself fades away. We already saw examples in the previous chapters of Zeami and Bashō explaining what made for great theater and meaningful poetry. Cursory examination will discover artistic canons for virtually every other conceivable artistic practice. Once a style emerges, critics and artists set out to explain what makes a work good or bad.

Whichever specific object-centric theory one favors, it is clear that existence of such a vast range of theories casts doubt on the viability any particular one as comprehensive. Such theories are subject to the passing whims of history and milieu. They inevitably enshrine the tastes of their creators. When painters paint colorful canvases, the critics praise vividness; when painters paint subdued canvases, the critics praise restraint. Each theory has too specific of a vision of what a proper form is to extend its domain beyond a limited territory.

One approach to resolving this difficulty is to focus on the art object itself even more strongly, to the exclusion of any generalization about its form. A theorist might claim that art objects *just are* and canons only come along afterwards to try to systematize what cannot be formally encapsulated. Indeed, art objects are often invested with a kind of inexplicable “aura” or historicity. For example, a perfect copy of a Van Gogh painting that is formally identical to the original would not have the same economic value as an original Van Gogh. Furthermore, many would insist that it also properly lacks the same artistic value as the original. There is a certain value possessed by the original art object that no copy can ever possess, no matter how exactly it duplicates the outer form of the original. One might try to explain this value in terms of the artist as the cause of the work. It might be suggested that the difference between the two lies in the fact that the original was created by the artist in an act of expression, whereas the copy was created for merely base commercial reasons. However, such a theory will be unable to explain why another person who happened to have the same character and experiences as Van Gogh would not be able to spontaneously create paintings of identical artistic value.† The object itself has a primitive value apart from its creator but not reducible to its form.

† For a humorous example of an author attempting to replicate the form of a work without replicating the mindset of the original artist, see J. L. Borges’ short story “Pierre Menard, Author of the _Quixote_.”

Pushed too far, this sort of intense focus on the art object is not a theory at all, just the bare assertion that some things *are* art. It would be an art ontology that denies the possibility of an art epistemology. However one could create a hybrid theory combining a formal explanation of the qualities of outstanding art objects with an emphasis on the haecceity of particular objects. Each work has a particularity all its own, which no other work possesses. Certain objects have a kind of artistic sacredness because of their historicity. The goal of artistic practice is to utilize certain formal techniques which bring the haecceity to the fore in the mind of the audience.

But who are the audience and what sort of response ought they to have to the art object? How can we tell when the artist has successfully brought the value of the object to their attention?

####Audience-centric theories
How should art affect its audience? The purpose of art is a topic that has been debated just as extensively as the topic of what art is. Indeed, there is widespread disagreement about whether art can or should have a purpose or not. If art does have a purpose, is it to affect the audience or to relive the artist of some inner pressure? I will briefly consider a few theories of audience response to art.

One common theory of the purpose of art is that art is for moral instruction. In the strong form of this theory, all art is didactic; it is only that sometimes the artists do not know how their art is instructing others. In a weaker form, good art is art that allows for the proper instruction of others, neutral art is that which has no effect, and bad art is that which leads to corruption. Although this family of theories may seem quite vulgar to aesthetes, it finds backing from such well-respected sources as Leo Tolstoy and Plato. Tolstoy in _What is Art?_ explains that the activity of art is based on the “capacity of man to receive another man's expression of feeling and experience those feelings himself” (5.5) and that as a result “The stronger the infection [of feeling and experience in the audience], the better is the art as art” (15.29).† Plato in the early books of the _Republic_ has Socrates discuss music and poetry solely as it relates to the education of the auxiliaries and guardians and seems to take this as their purpose.

[^]: Tolstoy, Leo. _What is Art?_. Tr. Alymer Maude. Available online at `http://www.csulb.edu/~jvancamp/361r14.html` as Spring 2010.

One possible alternative purpose for art can be seen in the tenth book of the _Republic_ when poetry is banned for its overly broad mimesis of things the poet does not know. Many in the public seem to take mimesis of visual experience to be the defining quality of visual art, and they seem positively offended by the nineteenth and twentieth century trends away from mimesis and towards expression and abstraction. Although mimesis is somewhat mystifying as a purpose for art (why should I want a perfect visual copy of a table rather than a real table that I can really use?), it cannot be denied that art is often utilized for its mimetic abilities and ranked according to its fidelity of mimesis.

Similar to theories of simple mimesis are theories of refined mimesis. In these theories, the purpose of art is not simply to double the world like a mirror but to bring out its most salient aspects for their contemplation by an audience. In chapter three, we looked at Aristotle's theory of catharsis. If Aristotle is right that the function of art is to relieve the emotions of the audience, then perhaps art's essence lies in its ability to so affect the audience. The audience is, as in didactic art, brought to greater understanding of life and their place in the world by engaging with art that takes the chaos of raw experience and transforms it into something aesthetically appreciable.

Other theories about the purpose of art place less emphasis on the fact that art allows for the aesthetic re-appreciation of the world than the disinterested enjoyment of aesthetic experience itself. These theories are closely connected to theories of “art for art’s sake.” Disinterested enjoyment is taken to be different from mere pleasure but nevertheless good for its own sake without any need for further instrumental value. The appreciation for the world gained by aesthetic experience may or may not lead to any difference in one’s behavior or activity in the world, but the experience itself is nevertheless of value. Art objects, for these theories, are any objects which assist in the inducing of aesthetic experiences in some audience.

One difficulty for theories of audience response is that two observers may have different experiences when faced with the same object or situation. Theories about the “ideal observer” attempt to circumvent this shortcoming by describing what sort of observer is best positioned to have the right kind of aesthetic experience. Such theories can be further combined with earlier theories of didactic art by postulating that the enculturation of the individual so as to be able to have a certain kind of aesthetic experience is best spurred on by prior exposure to other art objects in a certain progression in a manner similar to moral education. Theories of the ideal observer can be further combined with larger moral, political, or religious ideals in order to describe the sort of individual who, it is hoped, will be the product of a proper aesthetic education. Thus, even though both theories of the ideal observer and theories of art for art’s sake emphasize the importance of the aesthetic experience of the audience, these two categories of theories may be strongly opposed to one another, since ideal observer theories describe the creation of ideal observers as the purpose for which art exists.

To talk about "ideal" observers necessarily draws us away from a discussion of the audience themselves and into a discussion of what makes an audience ideal. That is, the discussion turns away from the audience and becomes ethical in that it discusses the broader social sphere in which the audience is situated.

####Context-centric theories
- Cathedrals, temples, etc. are mechanisms to rip us out of our normal context and insert us into the context of the supra-mundane.

Theories of art that focus on the artist, the object, and the audience were long thought to exhaust the possibilities for how to think about art, but in the twentieth-century a new approach to art emerged that looked not at any one aspect of this triangle in isolation, but the context out of which the three emerge. These are context-centric theories of art.

Let's reading Heidegger!


For Watsuji, the where of creation is climate and the when of creation is history. These will be examined in greater depth in chapter 5.<!--§--> For now, I will term the where-and-when of a work of art its "place" on analogy to Aristotle's _topos_, Nishida's _basho_ [場所] [ja], or Watsuji's _aidagara_. The place of a thing is as much of a requirement as any other cause, since an object or process which lacks a place in space and time cannot be said exist in the conventional sense. Having a place imparts a relational dimension to an object that lets us ask about its surroundings as well as its direct causes. In a non-reductive view of an artwork, its context will be inseparable from the more central content into which we are inquiring. By understanding the "place" of a thing, we come to understand the sort of context that gives rise to it.

Returning to the topic of the religious origin of art, one can say that the original “place” of the Venus de Milo was a temple, but through the twists of history, the statue lost that original place and ended up in the gallery of the Louvre.<!--§Ditto revival--> 

On the other hand, the original place of Duchamp’s urinal was, of course, the restroom. Nevertheless, having been selected by the artist, its new place is also the gallery. The gallery is a place that inherits the social role of the temple in the same way that secular theater inherits the role of the religious rite. In these cases, what was originally a *divine* ecstasy is secularized into a communal aesthetic experience. As mentioned in the section on material causation, art objects have a kind of “aura” of originality. A theory of art as the inheritor of the place of civil religion will point out that cult objects are also thought to have a literal aura in virtue of their position in a sacred place.[^] Artists on this theory are kind of literal priesthood who have the ability to transubstantiate things from being vulgar objects to being art objects merely by introducing them to the gallery space in the proper way. Once so installed, ordinary people will make pilgrimages from great distances in order to have their lives improved by contact (usually only visual contact) with the set-apart objects.

[^]: Cf. Matthew 23:17, in which Jesus rhetorically asks, “for which is greater, the gold, or the temple that hath sanctified the gold?” It is clear that Jesus sees the sacredness of the temple as a place lending sacredness to the contents of the temple.

The theory that the gallery historically inherits the place of the temple accounts for many of the more romantic or grandiose sentiments that are attached to art, but it fails to account for who the artists and art critics are and what activity unites them. If they are a priesthood of some sort, they must have set of dogmas and rituals that give them common purpose and make them one priesthood and not another. One widely received theory of art in the twentieth century is Arthur Danto’s “Artworld” theory. On this theory, artists select works (some commenters use the term “baptize”) and submit them to relevant individuals in the Artworld for consideration. If they approve of an object, then it becomes art. If they do not, it remains what it is. The topic of conversation that sets the Artworld apart from other groups of human beings is “aesthetic predicates.” The Artworld considers the aesthetic experience of the object that is possible when certain formal properties (in the broad sense of formal) are taken into account and progresses by developing new and more interesting predicates as time goes on. Understanding an art object means understanding the aesthetic experience the object would provoke in its intended Artworld and in the Artworld as it stands today. When the object’s place in the Artworld is grasped, the object is known.[^]

[^]: The process of properly understanding an art object for Danto is similar to the process of objectively understanding a physical object for Kant with the Artworld taking the place of transcendental Reason. For Kant, an understanding is objective if it accords with the understanding that would be produced by a being that possesses Reason. For Danto, an understanding of art is proper if it accords with the understanding that would be produced by a member of the Artworld. Also like Kant, Danto sees the great artist as a kind of genius who increases our store of concepts (“predicates”) by which we can recognize beauty (“aesthetic experiences”). 

####Commonalities in art theories

It is a philosopher’s delusion to think that behind our jumbled ordinary intuitions there must stand a single unified and determinative definition for the concept in question. As such, so long as we are exploring the space of possible concepts permitted by our intuitions, we will never find the unifying factor that lies behind the concept. Rather than “finding” this unifying factor, the philosopher must _create_ it by looking at what exactly it is what use the concept to do and what we ought to be using the concept to do. As Plato analogizes in Book VI of the _Republic_, it is only in the light of the Good that we see the essence of things. In Watsuji's terms, without focusing first on the practical good of something in human existence, we will not understand its existence (*sonzai*).<!--have I explained sonzai yet?§-->

Looking at how various theories of art are used, it is clear that the definition of art is at its most contested when the matter of prestige is on the line. Sometimes a discipline will claim the mantle of “art” in order to raise its prestige, and other times prestige is increased by rejecting the title of art and claiming the title of “science.”[^] The public fascination surrounding the question of “what is art?” turns on precisely this issue. Besides a basic confusion of “art” and “good art,” the debate reflects the fact that there is a public norm which holds that art is an unconditioned good. As such, for anyone to claim the title of art is necessarily for that individual to demand a certain level of public approbation. On the other hand, “science” is also a term of respect, and so the question “What is science?” has a similar level of purchase with the public. 

[^]: For an example of positioning a discipline relative to art in order to calibrate its prestige see: Knuth, Donald. "Computer Programming as Art" in _Communications of the ACM_. Vol. 17 (1974), pp. 667–673.

Frequently, certain activities which might otherwise be taken to be arts (for example, quilting, weaving, or glass blowing) are rejected as mere crafts or skilled traded. On the other side of the coin, those who find modern art distasteful express their distaste not by saying that abstract painting is an inferior art but by claiming that it is not an art at all. Such debates are not dissimilar to the debate among school children about whether cheerleading or gymnastics count as “sports” because they are scored by judges. The arguments given, however worthwhile on their own, are of secondary importance to the deeper cause of the debate, which is an attempt to order the values of society in a certain way. To call cheerleading a sport is to place a stereotypically female activity on a plane with masculine activities. So too, to call Jackson Pollock an artist is to put him in a category of secular veneration alongside Michelangelo and da Vinci.

###History as temporal context
  - Time
  - There are at least three meanings of “history”.
    - 1. Everything that really happened.
    - 2. The important things that happened.
    - 3. How we recalled or are shaped by the past.
  - Hume on taste x history
  - Jusosei
    - shinmin no michi
    - Hegel (via Bellah via review): Those moments which the spirit appears to have outgrown still belong to it in the depths of its present. Just as it has passed through all its moments in history, so also must it pass through them again in the present.
    - PoMo
- History as double negation: 1. Establish a style 2. Break out!

###Milieu as spatial context
  - Space
    - 空 as 空間性
    - Space as Aida
  - Talk about the book fūdo
    - fūdoki
    - Fūdo as travel literature
  - Seken as time-space bridge? Or save it for the Public/Private discussion of 6?
  - Complaining about cold in Hawaii
  - Humans are unique in that we live in every climate from Antarctica to the Sahara. Most lifeforms either can’t do that or they just go to the other climate directly without having to specifically adapt culturally.
  - Climate has similar issues with “subjectivity” and “objectivity.” Both of them are both psychic and regular.
  - Climate:History::Body:Spirit. In evolution, organisms adapt to and create a climate, changing their bodies as they do so, but as expression of the spirit of progression towards good.
  - For Watsuji, it’s not that the environment is a pool of resources to satisfy our own desires. Rather, the environment is a subjective space out which our desires emerge. Thus, Watsuji’s environmental ethics won’t be overly instrumental, even if he does seem to be anthropocentric.
    - We are interconnected both as agents and as observers. So, fūdo isn’t just a resource pool for us. We want fish because we have fish. We need to understand our “debts” to history and to climate.
    - It's not that Americans loved cars and built suburbs. They built roads and then loved their cars for taking them down those roads.
- Tea!
- Unclassified
  - Ancient Greeks and Easter Islanders are both dead, but it’s better to have been a Greek
  - Fūdo vs. Oku no Hosomichi as travel literature.
  - Takarazuka as a dialectical evolution.
    - All women as a response to all men
  - For Watsuji, even highly subjective phenomena like our gustatory desires arise out of a wider matrix:
- Temp
  - Spatial and temporal aspects of the subject
  - Post-modern multilayering, not sublation
  - Locating the genius in an ethos
