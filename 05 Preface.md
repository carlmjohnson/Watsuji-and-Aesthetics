<h2 class="roman">Preface</h2>
<h3 class="roman">Inspiration</h3>

The genesis of this dissertation is multifaceted, but I would like to take this opportunity to highlight a few key moments of inspiration. I have been fascinated with the work of the twentieth century Japanese philosopher [Watsuji][sc] Tetsurō since reading Yamamoto and Carter’s *Watsuji Tetsurō’s* Rinrigaku: *Ethics in Japan* as an undergraduate under David Shaner at Furman University. Watsuji’s blend of Buddhist, Confucian, and Western philosophy has been an inspiration to me and was one of the motivating factors in my coming to the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa to study comparative philosophy.

Watsuji was born on March 1, 1889 in what is now Himeji, Hyōgo prefecture, Japan. His father was a physician, and his family arranged for the young Watsuji to study at the First Higher School in Tokyo, after which he went on to study at Tokyo Imperial University. He attempted to write a graduate thesis on Nietzsche, but his instructors felt that Nietzsche was insufficiently philosophical, so instead he had to defend a hastily written thesis on Schopenhauer. After graduating, Watsuji became a member of the circle around the novelist Natsume Sōseki, and this proved to be an important impetus in his gradual movement away from Western individualism and towards a more balanced theory of self and other. After an incident in which his father asked him how his work would benefit Japan, Watsuji began to think more deeply about the role of philosophy in society. Throughout his career, Watsuji attempted to show through his work that there is a continuity between historically grounded cultural criticism and reflective philosophical analysis. After a few years of teaching, in 1925 Watsuji joined the philosophy department of Kyoto Imperial University then headed by [Nishida][sc] Kitarō. In 1927, Watsuji was dispatched to Europe as part of a government scholarship. While there Watsuji was able to be among the first to read Martin Heidegger’s _Being and Time_, which proved to be an important influence on his later work. During the war, Watsuji tried to position himself on the side of the more clear eyed Imperial Navy against the militant far right factions, but since the war, this positioning has come under serious critique from the left. After the war, Watsuji wrote various works explaining the tragedy as a result of Japan’s attempting to close itself off from foreign influences. Watsuji passed away on December 20, 1960 at the age of seventy-one, just as Geoffery Bownas was preparing the first translation of one of his books into English.

When I was trying to formulate a dissertation proposal, I was interested in involving Watsuji’s philosophy somehow but unsure of what direction to take. I feel that at this point commentators have adequately explained the basics of Watsuji’s life and work, and, as with Heidegger, critiques and defenses of Watsuji’s wartime activities have merit but can easily devolve into mere polemic if not anchored by a larger philosophical aim. Rather than just writing *about* Watsuji, I wished to *use* his theories to solve or at least illuminate an existing problem in the philosophical literature.

The key came as I was speaking with my committee chair Steve Odin about David Gordon’s dissertation on Watsuji and Nietzsche, “Self-Overcoming as the Overcoming of Modernity.” Because I had recently been working on a translation of the preface to Watsuji’s *Revival of the Idols* with David Ashworth, I suddenly saw that the Dionysian ecstasy celebrated by Nietzsche had to be balanced with an Apollonian detachment, as described in Professor Odin’s _Artistic Detachment in Japan and the West: Psychic Distance in Comparative Aesthetics_. The fulcrum of this balance would be the process of double negation explained in Watsuji’s *Ethics*. According to Watsuji’s theory, human existence consists of our individuating ourselves through a negation of emptiness and returning to community through a negation of individuality. I realized that the same process is present in aesthetic experience as the individuating of Apollonian distancing and the communalizing of Dionysian dissolution. 

Once the core of this inspiration was in place, the rest was just the slow matter of reading, thinking, writing, discussing, and revising until I felt that I had adequately worked out the implications of Watsuji’s thought for aesthetics. While the writing was never easy, at the same time, I never hit a writer’s block because the central idea lent itself to so many avenues of exploration. 

<h3 class="roman">Introductory sketch</h3>
In what follows, I first explain that the central problem of aesthetics is the problem of subjectivity and objectivity in aesthetic judgment. Without being able to address this most basic problem, our answers to many of the other pressing questions of aesthetics will always be in doubt. However, we cannot answer this question adequately without a clear explanation of what subjectivity and objectivity are, and this requires a thoroughly worked out anthropology.

To provide such an anthropology, in chapter two I introduce the work of Watsuji and his theory of the human being as individual and social. According to Watsuji, human beings are not independently existing individuals nor are they mere members of a social super-organism. Neither the individual moment nor the social moment in human existence is substantive. Rather, human existence is a process of double negation whereby we negate our emptiness in order to individuate ourselves and we negate our individuality in order to form communal wholes. Also in chapter two, I introduce Watsuji’s theory of hermeneutics as a methodology for what follows. 

In chapter three, I examine aesthetic experience and find that it too is a process of double negation. In the first instance we negate our surroundings in order to create a sense of aesthetic distance, and in the second instance we negate our ordinary selves in order to dissolve into the background of felt experience. In chapter four, I examine aesthetic normativity and find that aesthetic judgment and taste are similarly moments of negation that create individuals and communities. In chapter five, I look at theories of art through the lens of Watsuji’s work and show that artistic evolution is a process by which the context of artist, artwork, and audience develop into a meaningful historical milieu. In chapter six, I examine the phenomena of genius and its peculiar ability to create objects that travel beyond their original contexts and create new contexts around them. These objects, I argue, are the fruitful result of the double negation of criticism and genius.

Along the way, I illustrate my points with extended explanations of Noh theater, Japanese linked verse, tea ceremony, and *The Tale of Genji* (*Genji Monogatari* [源氏物語][ja]). These examples have the effect of showing that art and aesthetic experience are never the product of a single causal factor. Rather, they are the outcome of a dynamic interplay whereby the movement of double negation is able to express its inner significance. In Noh theater, the actor puts his self into the audience, while the audience loses itself in the character. Participants in a linked verse meeting each pick up on the spirit of the whole without thereby losing individuality or the unique emotional connotations of the subject of their verse. The beauty of the tea ceremony lies not in the particular tea, particular tea master, particular tea drinkers, etc., etc., but in the absolutely perfect realization of the context as a concrete individual expression of the whole. Even *The Tale of Genji*, which in all likelihood was the work of a single author, cannot be understood apart from the interplay of individual with community. The critical environment into which the work was received and the subsequent changes in that environment introduced by the work cannot be ignored when we attempt to account for the total effect of its genius. What all of my examples reveal is that Watsuji was right and human existence can only be understood when we see it as an dynamic overturning of individual and communal moments.

This dissertation is entitled “[Watsuji][sc] Tetsurō and the Subject of Aesthetics.” The title contains “The Subject of Aesthetics” because I both attempt to address the question of the subject and object in aesthetics and also to discuss the topic of aesthetics generally. It contains “[Watsuji][sc] Tetsurō and” because I hope that even as I address what Watsuji’s views of aesthetics were, I will also be to speak with him as a partner in what is ultimately a new dialogue. Throughout the whole of this dissertation I attempt to blend Buddhist non-substantivism, Confucian relationality, and post-Kantian aesthetics. Here too, Watsuji is an important inspiration and guide for me, and I hope that my attempt at creating a philosophy that bridges East and West can be as successful as his.
