##Preface
###Inspiration
The genesis of this dissertation is multifaceted, but I would like highlight a few key moments of inspiration before beginning. Since reading Carter and Yamamoto's *Watsuji Tetsurō's* Rinrigaku: *Ethics in Japan* under David Shaner at Furman University as an undergraduate, I have been fascinated with the work of the twentieth century Japanese philosopher [Watsuji][sc] Tetsurō. His blend of Buddhist, Confucian, and Western philosophy has been an inspiration to me and was one of the motivating factors in my coming to the University of Hawaiʻi Mānoa to study comparative philosophy. When I was trying to formulate a dissertation proposal, I was interested in using Watsuji's philosophy but unsure of what direction to take. I feel that the primary terms of Watsuji's work have been adequately explained by commentators at this point, and, as with Heidegger, critiques and defenses of Watsuji's wartime activities have merit but can easily devolve into mere polemic if not anchored by a larger philosophical aim. Rather than just writing *about* Watsuji's work, I wished to *use* his theories to solve or at least illuminate an existing problem in the philosophical literature.

The key came as I was speaking with my committee chair Steve Odin about David Gordon's dissertation on Watsuji and Nietzsche, “Self-Overcoming as the Overcoming of Modernity.” Because I had recently been working on a translation of the preface to Watsuji's *Revival of the Idols* with David Ashworth, I suddenly saw that the Dionysian ecstasy celebrated by Nietzsche had to be balanced with an Apollonian detachment, as described in Professor Odin's _Artistic Detachment in Japan and the West: Psychic Distance in Comparative Aesthetics_. The fulcrum of this balance would be the process of double negation explained in Watsuji's *Ethics*. According to Watsuji's theory, human existence consists of our individuating ourselves through a negation of emptiness and returning to community through a negation of individuality. I realized that the same process is present in aesthetic experience as the individuating of Apollonian distancing and the communalizing of Dionysian dissolution. 

Once this inspiration was in place, the rest was just the slow matter of reading, thinking, writing, discussing, and revising until I felt that I had adequately worked out the implications of Watsuji's thought as a system of aesthetics. While the writing was never easy, at the same time, I never felt myself to be in writer's block because the central idea lent itself to so many avenues of exploration. 

###Sketch of what follows
BLARGH, In what follows, first i explain that the central problem in aesthetics is the subj/obj split. then i explain that to get at the subj/obj split we need an anthropology because what is it to be subjective in the first place. for this i turn to watsuji and his anthropology of ningen or the twofold character of human existence as individual and communal. in addition i lay out my hermeneutic methodology of refinement from everyday xp to universal processes. next i get all up into aesthetic experience and how that can be understood as a double negation of distance and dissolution. from there, aesthetic normativity follows as well as a double negation of individual aesthetic judgment and communal taste. art is a double negation as new styles replace old in the concretion of context. genius is a double negation of criticism and creativity.

along the way, this can be seen in my examples: noh, haiku, tea, and genji.

along the way my themes are a buddhist non-substantivism, a confucian relationality, and a post-kantian theory of aesthetics. in that sense, i feel like i'm a watsuji too!
