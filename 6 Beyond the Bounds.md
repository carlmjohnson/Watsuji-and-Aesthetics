###Deconstructing aesthetics
In this dissertation, I have attempted to apply the anthropology and methodology of [Watsuji][ja] Tetsurō to aesthetics. The final step in this hermeneutic process is to deconstruct aesthetics into its most general components. How is hermeneutic destruction possible? As Watsuji writes in _Study of Ethics_, “self-awareness (_jikaku_ [自覚][ja]) of particularity is the only path (*michi* [道][ja]) by which to go beyond particularities” (WTZ 10:49). Abstract theory must be grounded on the basis of concrete experience. One particular experience will be the key for this chapter. That experience is the experience of genius, that is, the experience of works which go beyond the boundaries of the particular contexts of their creation and spread over space and time.

As the title “[Watsuji][sc] Tetsurō and the Subject of Aesthetics” implies, I have primarily focused on the importance of subjective factors in aesthetics. Aesthetic experience is a matter of a subject's disinterested enjoyment. Aesthetic judgment requires subjects to come together to assess the fullness of the object. Theories of art must account for the context in which subjects encounter art objects. However, I hope I have also shown something of the importance of the object itself. Works of genius certainly show us that this importance is not to be slighted. These works carry new worlds with them and invite us to enter into them.
They speak to us across the chasm of historical and climactic difference by bringing a context with them.

Before we can look directly at the question of how works of genius are able to carry a world with them it is necessary to look at the context of this world traveling. In other words, we need to look at the nature of criticism itself. In a certain sense, a critic must be a lover. Put in less provocative terms, critics must be able to feel a pure empathy for the work under consideration and convey this empathetic attitude to others.

Once we understand the role of the critic, we may ask about the role of geniuses in society. Is the genius an individual opposed to all social restraint? Or is genius a crystallized expression of the structure of a particular society? Paradoxically, in opposing society, the genius expresses its highest significance. This is why genius is able to push the boundaries of society forward. To grasp this process, we must see how it is that private values are exteriorized into society and vice-versa, how public values are internalized and felt subjectively. An examination of this process leads us to reevaluate the false choice presented between a liberal society in which public and private values are fixed in permanent division and a totalitarian society in which no distinction between public and private values is made.

Finally, I wish to conclude with a concrete discussion of Murasaki Shikibu, a genius of Japanese literature and author of *The Tale of Genji* (*Genji Monogatari* [源氏物語][ja]), as well as the critics who were vital to our reception of her work.

###Criticism and empathy
Both individuality and sociality are necessary for artistic creation. In the distant past it may have been that these two aspects of artistic creation were not well distinguished, but now at least, the social side of this process has been institutionalized as "criticism." Let us refer to the individual side of the process as "genius." Artistic creativity comes from the intersection of genius and criticism as a double negation. The artist may retreat to the studio alone to create a work, but when the work is done it must be presented to the public for appreciation. Without some individuality, there would be no novelty to the work. It would only present the preexistent ideas of the group. On the other hand, without sociality there could be no individuality. The ideas that the individual creatively enhances come from the group and must return to the group if they are to have any future efficacy. The works of the individual require the group for its evaluation. Genius, however radical and new it may be, is always an extension of existing art history, and purported genius that does not affect the future growth of art history is not true genius.

Naturally, part of the project of criticism will be negative: we define ourselves as a group by excluding what it is that we reject. We hate this; we reject this; we find this vulgar. But there is also a positive side to criticism: we embrace certain objects and are united by our shared values. We love this; we accept this; we find this refined. These two aspects of criticism are important but inward facing. The works themselves, to the extent they matter, matter only insofar as they promote or hinder our unity as a critical community. A full account of criticism must also strive to understand why works come to possess the power to unite or divide critics.

One approach to the criticism of art work is to be critical, that is, to criticize. One can search the object closely for faults in order to seize on them and present them to its creator and others. This attitude, however, is clearly of more use in fostering one’s reputation among fellow connoisseurs than it is for allowing one to aesthetically engage with the object. It has its place, but it is not strictly aesthetic insofar as it cuts off the possibility of engagement with the object.

In a short essay entitled “Art Criticism” (_Geijutsu Hihyō_ [芸術批評][ja]), Watsuji explains the approach of the French philosopher Jean-Marie Guyau (1854--1888) to criticism and his own. Both are opposed to the brand of criticism that seeks only to tear down. Watsuji interprets Guyau’s view as being, “one who we ought to call a critic is one who best sings praises to the beautiful and also one best able to explain this praise to others” (WTZ 17:189). While agreeing with this sentiment, Watsuji feels that we must not lose sight of the source of criticizing criticism either. In his view, “The ideal critic knows best how to praise beauty, while also being at the same time the most sensitive towards the ugly” (WTZ 17:190). When the critic criticizes, it should not be out of a desire to impress others with one’s snobbish sophistication, but out of a sensitivity to the ways that object came so close to achieving greatness but fell short.

The attitude a critic must possess in order to simultaneously praise the beautiful and criticize the bad is, Watsuji and Guyau agree, love. Love, of course, can be understood in many ways beyond even the traditional Greek distinctions between *agapé* <!--[ἀγάπη][el]--> (“charitable love”), *eros* <!--[ἔρως][el]--> (“erotic love”), *philia* <!--[φιλία][el]--> (“brotherly love”), and *storgé* <!--[στοργή][el]--> (“familial affection”). To add in distinctions from the East Asian tradition, we might also mention [慈悲][zh] (Ch. _cibei_, Jp. _jihi_, “compassion”),  [戀][zh] (Ch. *lian*, Jp. _koi_, “yearning love”), [愛][zh] (Ch. _ai_, Jp. _ai_, “possessive love”), and [仁][zh] (Ch. _ren_, Jp. _jin_, “humane conduct”). Each of these concepts of love has a different shade of meaning that has evolved historically and each reveals a different aspect of the attitude needed for aesthetic judgment, but the thread that runs through them as concepts is the sense of outward yearning concern.

In _Study of Ethics_, Watsuji mentions one view of love given by Hegel (WTZ 10:87). I believe Hegel captures something common to our conceptions of love in his _Philosophy of Right_:

> Love is in general the consciousness of the unity of myself with another. I am not separate and isolated, but win my self-consciousness only by renouncing my independent existence, and by knowing myself as unity of myself with another and of another with me. […] The first element in love is that I will to be no longer an independent self-sufficing person, and that, if I were such a person, I should feel myself lacking and incomplete. The second element is that I gain myself in another person, in whom I am recognized, as he again is in me. Hence love is the most tremendous contradiction, incapable of being solved by the understanding. Nothing is more obstinate than this scrupulosity of self-consciousness, which, though negated, I yet insist upon as something positive. Love is both the source and solution of this contradiction. As a solution it is an ethical union. (§158, 139)

Watsuji summarizes, “love is the contradiction that to abandon oneself is to acquire oneself” (WTZ 10:88). For the purposes of understanding aesthetic judgment, what love must mean is one’s identity as a subject requires a willingness to go beyond one’s horizons while accepting the otherness of the object. That is, love desires the other without needing to possess it or smother it. To the contrary, the lover finds herself only by losing herself to the beloved. The feeling of disinterested enjoyment rests on just this. 

In Plato’s _Symposium_, Aristophanes tells a myth about the origin of love. Once, human beings were wholes with four arms, four legs, and two faces, but now we have been divided into halves as punishment by the gods. As a result, we spend our lives searching for our lives in search of a lover to complete us, that is, searching for our other halves:

> Why should this be so? It’s because, as I said, we used to be complete wholes in our original nature, and now “Love” is the name for our pursuit of wholeness, for our desire to be complete. (192e)

The form of love that makes criticism possible is similar in that it too is a drive to reunify in cleavage what was originally together without division. In criticism, we are not just looking for another person to complete us, but for oneness with the emptiness out of which subject and object co-arise. This return with difference is the foundation of aesthetic goodness and the drive that compels our experiences to evolve in progressively novel forms.

To be sure, an overemphasis on the word “love” as the attitude of the critic can lead to a misunderstanding of what aesthetic judgment calls for. Again, the critic must always be ready to criticize the ugliness of the ugly. While this is compatible with a deeper understanding of love, it easily becomes obscured if our concept of love is too shallow. Another way of conceptualizing the attitude needed for aesthetic judgment that may prevent this misunderstanding is as empathy. The word “empathy” was coined as a translation of the German *[Einfühlung][de]*, which was popularized by German philosopher Theodor Lipps (1851--1914).† Watsuji mentions Lipps in his unfinished notes on art theory and wrote about him several times in _Revival of the Idols_ (_Guzō Saikō_ [偶像再興][ja]).† The German *[Einfühlung][de]* and the Greco-English “empathy” are both compounds meaning “in feeling.” The preposition “in” suggest that while outside the thing being empathized with, we nevertheless enter into it ecstatically. We feel from our position as subjects into the position of the object. In doing so, we come together with our fellow appreciators, the artist, and---most importantly---the object itself.

† See the etymology of empathy presented in the Oxford English Dictionary: "empathy, n.". *OED Online*. December 2011. Oxford University Press. `http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/61284`.

† See _Lipps and Nietzsche_ (_Rippusu to Niiche_ [リップスとニイチェ][ja], WTZ 17:167--171), _Lipps’s Individualism_ (_Rippusu no Kojinshugi_ [リップスの個人主義][ja], WTZ 17:172--174), and _Lipps’s Warning_ (_Rippusu no Keikoku_ [リップスの警告][ja], WTZ 17:175--178).

If we reexamine aesthetic experience in light of the importance of empathy to criticism, we find that the "disinterest" of "disinterested enjoyment" refers not to a disinterest in the object, but a disinterest in the prerogatives of the ordinary self. By looking on an object with empathy, we are able to appreciate what is good for the object apart from how the object could be instrumentally good for us. In the moment of ecstatic unity with the object, we do not seek to annihilate it or change it, but delight in its being what it is. It is for this reason that Buddhists and other religious practioners identify the perspective of the non-dual no self (*muga* [無我][ja]) with the gaze of compassion. In the feeling of beauty we get the sense that everything is in its right place and take joy from the dynamic goodness of the object itself. The role of the critic is to form a space in which the ordinary self can be set aside and the perspective of non-duality underlying ordinary experience can be uncovered.

###Individuality and sociality in genius
If criticism is the name we apply to the social pole of creative evolution as double negation, genius is the name of the individual pole of that relationship. However, can we consider genius as a purely individual phenomenon or must we also consider its relationship to a critical milieu?

Kant writes in the _Critique of Judgment_ that, “_Genius_ is the innate mental predisposition (_ingenium_) _through which_ nature gives the rule to art” (Ak. 307). On Kant’s theory, genius is an innate talent in particular individuals to create new rules of taste to match our indeterminate concept of beauty, rather than any communal capacity (though it is through this capacity that communal nature speaks). However, if we examine the concept of genius more closely, we find, as Hegel emphasizes, genius must speak to “the spirit of the times.” For one to paint like Picasso in the Renaissance would not have gotten one far, and to paint like Picasso today is merely to be an imitator. Moreover, as presented in the last chapter, the milieu of a work is not to be neglected. Frank Lloyd Wright's famous house "Fallingwater" would not be a work of genius if reproduced anywhere else in the world. Genius requires an empathic ability to read into the “vital energy” of one’s time and place.

In addition to this ability to read into the existing spirit of things, genius also seems to redirect the course of artistic history. In "The Decay of Lying," Oscar Wilde has an interlocutor remark,

> At present, people see fogs, not because there are fogs, but because poets and painters have taught them the mysterious loveliness of such effects. There may have been fogs for centuries in London. I dare say there were. But no one saw them, and so we do not know anything about them. They did not exist till Art had invented them. (41)

The passage is slightly hyperbolic, but Wilde's basic point is fair. As artistic genius penetrates into a culture, it changes the quality of our aesthetic experiences. Genius reveals to us a world that would have been otherwise invisible, and through the coming together of critical sentiment in aesthetic judgment, our perception is made sharper than it would otherwise be.

Genius reads into the world as it is, changes the world into something, and in addition to this travels from one world to another. A work of genius is born at a particular moment in history within a particular milieu, but it shows its inner genius when it then crosses those contextual boundaries and become a global phenomenon. The greatest artists are those who create global standards for art (think of Picasso who was Spanish by birth but celebrated worldwide) and the greatest works of art are those that function even beyond their original contexts (think of the Venus de Milo, which was originally a religious artifact). 

Examined according to Watsuji’s perspective, though genius is the individual pole of critic-genius relationship, it must not be seen as the possession of an individual alone. The _Odyssey_ is clearly a work of genius whether or not it was created by a single individual named Homer. Rather, we should see genius as the ability to create a work with a context inherent within it that spills out into the world of the audience who receive it. This process is “individual” in the sense that genius enriches the private experience of a world before opening it up to public criticism. This new world of the genius will be the crystallization of the historical and climactic conditions of its context of creation but also give rise to a new space of possibilities to project. Those great works of art like the Venus de Milo or the paintings of Picasso are great because they bring their ideals with them when they travel and instantly reconfigure the cultures into which they are introduced. Kant claims that genius is the ability to bring a rule of nature to art, but it would be better to see it as the ability to bring an object out of its context by expanding its context in unexpected new directions. What makes genius so fascinating is not just the individual accomplishment of a particular work or object, but the social achievement of an ability to create or alter the existing ethos of an aesthetic community. Genius is made possible by the pre-condition of a certain historical and climactic culture which it expresses, but genius goes beyond its origin to alter the possibility of future aesthetic experiences. Genius reads into its world with empathetic, loving identification, but then causes that empathetic love to spread to others and the world to grow.

Because of the nature of the subject as primarily active and embodied (_shutai_ [主体][ja]) rather than passive and disembodied (_shukan_ [主観][ja]), genius is better understood as a mode of creative activity than as just a form of insight. The activity of genius is a kind of “world traveling” in which the genius taps into the non-dual no self (*muga* [無我][ja]) that underlies the separation of the subject and object in ordinary experience. The “empathy” or "love" that makes this kind border crossing possible is an openness to the emptiness (*kū* [空][ja]) of the self and all things. By realizing the emptiness of things, the genius feels the contingency of the current configuration and begins to inhabit a new possibility through a concrete act of self-expression. The self thus expressed is not the ordinary self of everyday experience but the enlarged self of no self. What makes this process possible is the universal emptiness of things. Because all things are empty, there is always going to be more to reality than we can capture in a reduction, hence there will always be new worlds for genius to explore.†

† The computer scientist Alan Kay remarks, "All creativity is an extended form of a joke. Most creativity is a transition from one context into another where things are more surprising. There’s an element of surprise, and especially in science, there is often laughter that goes along with the ‘Aha.’ Art also has this element. Our job is to remind us that there are more contexts than the one that we’re in---the one that we think is reality" (Feldman, 29).

The activity of crossing from one world into another is valuable because it is this process that uncovers the seams of cleavage in ordinary experience. We feel differences by contrasting them, so movement from one world to another is the only way to uncover the structures that give a world its shape. This is why theory and understanding are so often retroactive rather than prospective. Only once the contrast has been experienced is its meaning clear. Because of this, our search for the most general form of aesthetics must be conducted in and through particulars. Genius creates something particular and great in private, then this private greatness reconfigures the values of the public by communicating this private feeling to each individually as well as to all collectively. To understand this process in greater depth we must next make a detour into the nature of private and public values.

      - Liberalism and totalitarianism are both "bad" in Watsuji's sense because they attempt to freeze the private/public distinction in one place. For totalitarianism, there is no private, which is bad, but for liberalism, the private is one corner of reality with no public meaning (behind the wall of church and state), which is also bad. To be good, the private should grow into the public and shrink out from it as necessary.
      - In liberalism, what’s private is private forever (religion) and what’s public is public forever (politics). For feminists and other Marxists, the personal is the political. (They’re totalitarians like that.) For Watsuji, 私 and 公 are negatively linked and interchange. We build up a sense of ourselves in 私 and then that cycles into the 公 eventually as a new, different realm of 私 bubbles up in the space newly created.

We have seen so far the deep relationship between social structures and the possibility of aesthetic experience and aesthetic judgment. However, religion also manifests itself ethically and socially, and moreover, it often does so through an appeal to aesthetic feeling. Hence it should be no surprise that throughout his career, Watsuji grappled with the role of religion in human existence. However, critics of Watsuji often contend that in his system he subordinated religion to the role of the state. These criticism are not without merit but must placed within the broader context of Watsuji’s life and career. In his earliest years, he followed Bernard Shaw, the English Romantics, and even Nietzsche in rejecting religion as an outmoded influence on society, but as time went on he began to reconsider its importance, but by the time of his _Revival of the Idols_ (1918), he had begun to shift his emphasis. Where for Nietzsche “idols” represent congealments of life that ought to be destroyed, Watsuji saw also their positive role in the progression of life. In “The Psychology of Idol Worship,” Watsuji explores the mindset of those Japanese who first accepted the foreign importation of Buddhism to Japan. Watsuji writes,

> What especially catches the eye is that they demanded artistic joy [*geijutsu-teki na kanki* 芸術的な歓喜] from religion. Going further than that, they tied their faith to this sensuous joy. The former is proved by the great art that was born of the Nara period. The latter is unquestionably proven by several prominent social phenomena which manifest how much power the priests of that era held over the human body. These characteristics may have varied in form to some degree but are surely apparent in every religion that has since been born in Japan. For example, the Dionysian elements (the physical movements and type of dance involved) in the Nichiren sect and the nembutsu sects provide prominent examples of this religious joy. However, while what appeared later was fairly strongly practical, in more ancient times it was especially and distinctly artistic. This close melding of art and religion is able to provide an extremely justified ground for idol worship.[^]

[^]: Translations from _Revival of the Idols_ are my own.

In other words, the ancient Japanese came to accept Buddhism as a religion first because of their love of the aesthetic, artistic joy it provided, and only later for its intellectual elements. Japanese Buddhism went through several distinct phases, starting with its establishment in the Nara period (710–794 CE). Where the earlier forms of Buddhism were more austere and aristocratic, later forms of Buddhism emphasized the efficacy of personal, popular devotion. In the Nichiren sect, it is held that the salvific power of the Lotus Sutra can be unlocked through the use of the proper mantras and mandalas, and the various nembutsu (念仏) sects held that keeping in mind (_nen_ 念) the name of the Buddha (_butsu_ 仏) of Infinite Light through chanting held life transforming power in this world and the next. Nichiren (日蓮, 1222–1282) was a Buddhist teacher who emphasized the importance of chanting _Namu Myōhō Renge Kyō_ (南無妙法蓮華経, “Hail to the Wonderful Law of the Flowering Lotus Sutra”) while meditating before a _Gohonzon_ 御本尊, a special mandala of Nichiren’s design. There are a variety of nembutsu sects (prominently, Hōnen [法然,1133–1212]’s Pure Land sect and Shinran [親鸞, 1173–1263]’s True Pure Land sect), but in general they emphasize that calling on the Buddha Amitābha by chanting _Namu Amida Butsu_ (南無阿弥陀仏, “Hail to the Buddha of Infinite Light”) will allow one to be reborn in the Pure Land in the next life, where salvation is much easier to achieve than in this world. However, Watsuji felt that these later forms of Buddhism were more practically oriented in comparison to earlier forms of Buddhism. Though the latter Buddhist sects did have strong aesthetic components, what allowed for the introduction of Buddhism in the first place was its direct aesthetic attractiveness. Again in Watsuji’s description of these Buddhist adherents, we see a structured detachment followed by an aesthetic rapture in the scene of those at a temple gathering listening to chanting of the monks:

> They who were intoxicated [_tōsui_ 陶酔] on music would sometimes open their enchanted eyes and gaze on the heavenly idols. They had already lost consciousness of themselves. They had already integrated the idols into their hearts, and in an infinity of gratitude and blessings they experienced an intense shining and a nimbleness of the whole heart.--Actually, their agitated hearts were extremely sensitive toward the statues and music. The strength and chiaroscuro of that inner life was no different in its extreme intensity of feeling, though it could not be called well defined. When all of their artistic results and religious influences were concentrated on just one point, that is, the veneration of idols, especially as in the aforementioned circumstances, the depth and strength of that ecstasy [_uchōten_ 有頂天] seems to be almost beyond our imaginations. In this way, our ancestors had tasted one kind of aesthetico-religious great joy [_bi-teki shūkyō-teki na dai-kanki_ 美的宗教的な大歓喜] in idol worship.

While the strong influence of Nietzsche’s thinking on Watsuji is apparent in this passage, we also see the beginnings of Watsuji’s independence. What Watsuji has shown is that the rigid structure and rules of Buddhism, anathema to the Dionysian Nietzsche, have provided the space in which the Japanese devotees can experience an aesthetic rapture together. The rapture of the monks was made possible first by their commitment to detachment from the world, which was the precondition of their losing themselves to the world. The turn from Nietzsche to Buddhism was natural for Watsuji once he found in Buddhism a similar appreciation for the importance of appreciating the flow of life unimpeded by conceptual congealing, but it also meant Watsuji was gaining appreciation for the positive value of idols, both literal and conceptual. Where Nietzsche casually sneers at the inauthenticity of Buddhism’s life negating tendencies (they are guilty of “denying the will”[^] and “longing for nothingness”[^]), Watsuji began to appreciate life affirming aspect of self-negation in the face of an awesome aesthetic other. Nietzsche was only aware of a caricatured portrait of South Asian non-Mahāyāna Buddhism, but Watsuji was thoroughly acquainted with both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna Buddhism, which gave him a better perspective on the ways in which Buddhism could be life affirming and embrace aesthetic experience. While both Watsuji and Nietzsche emphasize the importance of intoxication to the opening of the self to the Dionysian joy of aesthetic/religious ecstasy, Watsuji also begins to sympathize with the veneration of the idols as well, which is an act that would strike Nietzsche as servile and a betrayal of the will to power. As David B. Gordon argues, however, the common thread connecting Watsuji’s work before and after _A Study of Nietzsche_ is Watsuji’s recognition of the overcoming of self as the means of expressing the authenticity of the self.

In his preface to _Revival of the Idols_, Watsuji expands the themes of the essays in the collection by illustrating his point with the story of the Apostle Paul. According to Watsuji, Paul was disgusted by the Dionysian excesses of the ancient Athenians, and managed to so impress them with his disdain for idolatry that a period of iconoclasm followed for the better part of two millennia. Watsuji allows that this was for the best historically, and yet we cannot wholly rid ourselves of the idols:

> There is no need at this time to repeat that iconoclasm, or the destruction of idols, is indispensable as a way for life to progress. The flow of life is maintained by this path [*michi* 道] alone. Idols, which we unceasingly construct in our subconsciouses, must be destroyed by careful and unceasing effort.
>
> And yet, it is not that these idols are created without meaning. They ought to give a strength that has unity in the flow of life and guide the growth of life toward a healthy abundance and beauty. This is the indispensable duty which they have in our way of life. Stuck without them between the confusion of consciousness and the division of desires, a person will end up stunted. It is possible that some will even go so far as treating "nihility" [*kyomu* 虚無] as an idol in order to be able to lead a life of positivity.

What finally brought an end to the era of iconoclasm in the West was a literal return of the idols of the past. Ancient Greek and Roman statues were restored to positions of honor in society. However, their new position was by no means identical to what it had been before the period of iconoclasm:

> Nevertheless, idols that have been revived are no longer gods deserving of veneration. No one thought to offer before them a beast in sacrifice. No one thought to entrust his own fate into the hands of these idols. What caused the people tremble was not their being heretical gods but their beauty. Paul's expulsion of idols is something that should have been accepted as a matter of course only to the degree that the idols were taken to be gods for veneration. However, as works of art which are venerated for their beauty, the idols were offered unfair treatment by Paul. Now that unfair treatment is being recompensed, and the idols are seen by the people as possessing a dignity even as mere works of art.

In other words, statues like the Venus de Milo continue to possess a kind of awe inspiring power, but we no longer feel that power to be a religious one, but primarily an artistic one. This shows at the same time, the change brought about in the status of religion and the change in the status of art. New iconoclasts in the form of anti-clerical and even atheistic movements had taken root in the West, but their iconoclasm could not be total. So soon as they suppressed God, they found that they had to put “Art” on a pedestal. Watsuji writes,

> The Christian "God" is also a kind of idol. Paul expelled idols made by "the hands of men." The modern iconoclasts expelled gods made by "the heads of men." However, just as Paul could not completely purge the idols, the modern iconoclasts were also unable to completely purge God. Even after the much-discussed pronouncement that "God is dead,” a god-seeking heart stealthily takes root in the breast of the people.
>
> […]
>
> Though we have lost the name of God, nevertheless we cannot refrain from searching for a new name to give Him. Should we call Him "the Will”? Ought we to speak of Him as "the Absolute"? Or might we call Him "the Electron” as well? Perhaps these names ought to be cast out by a new Paul as demonic gods. We have built an altar to "the Unknown God" and await the appearance of a Paul that can clearly preach about God to us. And so we anticipate the destruction of all of the idols created by the spirit of modernity.

For his part, Watsuji sees both iconoclasm and idol worship as necessary moments in a process of historical unfolding. Neither can exist without the other, because they both bring us closer to discovering the hidden depths of the ordinary. There is a mysterious profundity in how things are on their own that is overlooked by ordinary consciousness but which we can recover when we use aesthetic awareness to alert us to the ecstatic interiority of things:

> I preach the path of righteousness. I suppose some will call this banal. I, however, am talking about the joy of discovering new life in the banal. I am trying to tell you about the sweetness of the nectar secreted away inside the shell of the banal. As for the banal--fixed ideas that are taken to have no life--we needs must first shake the dulled senses out of their sleep by waking [_satoru_ 悟る] the shell itself and then wield an iron hammer to break it apart. The eyes of new senses will for the first time be awakened to the revival of the idols. 
>
> I do not, however, merely aim to "resurrect the old." When the old is raised up again, the old shell is cast off and a new life shines forth. The fetters of time no longer apply in this new life. It is eternally young, eternally new. My aim is in this way to extoll the eternally present life. I feel a presentiment of a great path that converges in the heart of all idols. And I feel that all human efforts, past and future, in extremis will be gathered in the direction of this path.

Thus we see that for the early Watsuji, religion is not just a means of ethnic self-expression whereby the state comes to enlist higher ideals for its legitimation. At its best, religion is a means to aesthetic appreciation of the eternal in every moment. The difficulty is that over time religions inevitably evolve into mere “idol worship” and must be smashed by iconoclasm so that the innate impulse to religiosity can find new and better ways of expressing itself without being stifled by frozen conceptions of how things ought to be. While this understanding of religion does not make up for the shortcomings of Watsuji’s later “idolization” of the state, it helps put into perspective how such idolization came about, in that he came to identify the state with that power which drives the cycle of idolization and iconoclasm forward.

  - Watsuji on both
Finally, I wish to conclude with a concrete discussion of Murasaki Shikibu ([紫式部][ja], c. 973--1014? 1025?), a genius of Japanese literature and author of *The Tale of Genji* (*Genji Monogatari* [源氏物語][ja]), as well as the critics who were vital to our reception of her work.

###Conclusion
  - Museums are the one place where religion, nationalism, and aesthetics come together. Museums are substitute temples and often get filled with religious artifacts. They glorify their home nations either for plundering other people or for creating stuff itself. Cf. Heidegger’s theory of a work of art as temple based.
