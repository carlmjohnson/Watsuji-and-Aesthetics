###Deconstructing aesthetics
In this dissertation, I have attempted to apply the anthropology and methodology of [Watsuji][ja] Tetsurō to aesthetics. The final step in this hermeneutic process is to deconstruct aesthetics into its most general components. How is hermeneutic destruction possible? As Watsuji writes in _Study of Ethics_, “self-awareness (_jikaku_ [自覚][ja]) of particularity is the only path (*michi* [道][ja]) by which to go beyond particularities” (WTZ 10:49). Abstract theory must be grounded on the basis of concrete experience. One particular experience will be the key for this chapter. That experience is the experience of genius, that is, the experience of works which go beyond the boundaries of the particular contexts of their creation and spread over space and time.

As the title “[Watsuji][sc] Tetsurō and the Subject of Aesthetics” implies, I have primarily focused on the importance of subjective factors in aesthetics. Aesthetic experience is a matter of a subject's disinterested enjoyment. Aesthetic judgment requires subjects to come together to assess the fullness of the object. Theories of art must account for the context in which subjects encounter art objects. However, I hope I have also shown something of the importance of the object itself. Works of genius certainly show us that this importance is not to be slighted. These works carry new worlds with them and invite us to enter into them.
They speak to us across the chasm of historical and climactic difference by bringing a context with them.

Before we can look directly at the question of how works of genius are able to carry a world with them it is necessary to look at the context of this world traveling. In other words, we need to look at the nature of criticism itself. In a certain sense, a critic must be a lover. Put in less provocative terms, critics must be able to feel a pure empathy for the work under consideration and convey this empathetic attitude to others.

Once we understand the role of the critic, we may ask about the role of geniuses in society. Is the genius an individual opposed to all social restraint? Or is genius a crystallized expression of the structure of a particular society? Paradoxically, in opposing society, the genius expresses its highest significance. This is why genius is able to push the boundaries of society forward. To grasp this process, we must see how it is that private values are exteriorized into society and vice-versa, how public values are internalized and felt subjectively. An examination of this process leads us to reevaluate the false choice presented between a liberal society in which public and private values are fixed in permanent division and a totalitarian society in which no distinction between public and private values is made.

Finally, I wish to conclude with a concrete discussion of Murasaki Shikibu, a genius of Japanese literature and author of *The Tale of Genji* (*Genji Monogatari* [源氏物語][ja]), as well as the critics who were vital to our reception of her work.

###Criticism and empathy
Both individuality and sociality are necessary for artistic creation. In the distant past it may have been that these two aspects of artistic creation were not well distinguished, but now at least, the social side of this process has been institutionalized as "criticism." Let us refer to the individual side of the process as "genius." Artistic creativity comes from the intersection of genius and criticism as a double negation. The artist may retreat to the studio alone to create a work, but when the work is done it must be presented to the public for appreciation. Without some individuality, there would be no novelty to the work. It would only present the preexistent ideas of the group. On the other hand, without sociality there could be no individuality. The ideas that the individual creatively enhances come from the group and must return to the group if they are to have any future efficacy. The works of the individual require the group for its evaluation. Genius, however radical and new it may be, is always an extension of existing art history, and purported genius that does not affect the future growth of art history is not true genius.

Naturally, part of the project of criticism will be negative: we define ourselves as a group by excluding what it is that we reject. We hate this; we reject this; we find this vulgar. But there is also a positive side to criticism: we embrace certain objects and are united by our shared values. We love this; we accept this; we find this refined. These two aspects of criticism are important but inward facing. The works themselves, to the extent they matter, matter only insofar as they promote or hinder our unity as a critical community. A full account of criticism must also strive to understand why works come to possess the power to unite or divide critics.

One approach to the criticism of art work is to be critical, that is, to criticize. One can search the object closely for faults in order to seize on them and present them to its creator and others. This attitude, however, is clearly of more use in fostering one’s reputation among fellow connoisseurs than it is for allowing one to aesthetically engage with the object. It has its place, but it is not strictly aesthetic insofar as it cuts off the possibility of engagement with the object.

In a short essay entitled “Art Criticism” (_Geijutsu Hihyō_ [芸術批評][ja]), Watsuji explains the approach of the French philosopher Jean-Marie Guyau (1854--1888) to criticism and his own. Both are opposed to the brand of criticism that seeks only to tear down. Watsuji interprets Guyau’s view as being, “one who we ought to call a critic is one who best sings praises to the beautiful and also one best able to explain this praise to others” (WTZ 17:189). While agreeing with this sentiment, Watsuji feels that we must not lose sight of the source of criticizing criticism either. In his view, “The ideal critic knows best how to praise beauty, while also being at the same time the most sensitive towards the ugly” (WTZ 17:190). When the critic criticizes, it should not be out of a desire to impress others with one’s snobbish sophistication, but out of a sensitivity to the ways that object came so close to achieving greatness but fell short.

The attitude a critic must possess in order to simultaneously praise the beautiful and criticize the bad is, Watsuji and Guyau agree, love. Love, of course, can be understood in many ways beyond even the traditional Greek distinctions between *agapé* <!--[ἀγάπη][el]--> (“charitable love”), *eros* <!--[ἔρως][el]--> (“erotic love”), *philia* <!--[φιλία][el]--> (“brotherly love”), and *storgé* <!--[στοργή][el]--> (“familial affection”). To add in distinctions from the East Asian tradition, we might also mention [慈悲][zh] (Ch. _cibei_, Jp. _jihi_, “compassion”),  [戀][zh] (Ch. *lian*, Jp. _koi_, “yearning love”), [愛][zh] (Ch. _ai_, Jp. _ai_, “possessive love”), and [仁][zh] (Ch. _ren_, Jp. _jin_, “humane conduct”). Each of these concepts of love has a different shade of meaning that has evolved historically and each reveals a different aspect of the attitude needed for aesthetic judgment, but the thread that runs through them as concepts is the sense of outward yearning concern.

In _Study of Ethics_, Watsuji mentions one view of love given by Hegel (WTZ 10:87). I believe Hegel captures something common to our conceptions of love in his _Philosophy of Right_:

> Love is in general the consciousness of the unity of myself with another. I am not separate and isolated, but win my self-consciousness only by renouncing my independent existence, and by knowing myself as unity of myself with another and of another with me. […] The first element in love is that I will to be no longer an independent self-sufficing person, and that, if I were such a person, I should feel myself lacking and incomplete. The second element is that I gain myself in another person, in whom I am recognized, as he again is in me. Hence love is the most tremendous contradiction, incapable of being solved by the understanding. Nothing is more obstinate than this scrupulosity of self-consciousness, which, though negated, I yet insist upon as something positive. Love is both the source and solution of this contradiction. As a solution it is an ethical union. (§158, 139)

Watsuji summarizes, “love is the contradiction that to abandon oneself is to acquire oneself” (WTZ 10:88). For the purposes of understanding aesthetic judgment, what love must mean is one’s identity as a subject requires a willingness to go beyond one’s horizons while accepting the otherness of the object. That is, love desires the other without needing to possess it or smother it. To the contrary, the lover finds herself only by losing herself to the beloved. The feeling of disinterested enjoyment rests on just this. 

In Plato’s _Symposium_, Aristophanes tells a myth about the origin of love. Once, human beings were wholes with four arms, four legs, and two faces, but now we have been divided into halves as punishment by the gods. As a result, we spend our lives searching for our lives in search of a lover to complete us, that is, searching for our other halves:

> Why should this be so? It’s because, as I said, we used to be complete wholes in our original nature, and now “Love” is the name for our pursuit of wholeness, for our desire to be complete. (192e)

The form of love that makes criticism possible is similar in that it too is a drive to reunify in cleavage what was originally together without division. In criticism, we are not just looking for another person to complete us, but for oneness with the emptiness out of which subject and object co-arise. This return with difference is the foundation of aesthetic goodness and the drive that compels our experiences to evolve in progressively novel forms.

To be sure, an overemphasis on the word “love” as the attitude of the critic can lead to a misunderstanding of what aesthetic judgment calls for. Again, the critic must always be ready to criticize the ugliness of the ugly. While this is compatible with a deeper understanding of love, it easily becomes obscured if our concept of love is too shallow. Another way of conceptualizing the attitude needed for aesthetic judgment that may prevent this misunderstanding is as empathy. The word “empathy” was coined as a translation of the German *[Einfühlung][de]*, which was popularized by German philosopher Theodor Lipps (1851--1914).† Watsuji mentions Lipps in his unfinished notes on art theory and wrote about him several times in _Revival of the Idols_ (_Guzō Saikō_ [偶像再興][ja]).† The German *[Einfühlung][de]* and the Greco-English “empathy” are both compounds meaning “in feeling.” The preposition “in” suggest that while outside the thing being empathized with, we nevertheless enter into it ecstatically. We feel from our position as subjects into the position of the object. In doing so, we come together with our fellow appreciators, the artist, and---most importantly---the object itself.

† See the etymology of empathy presented in the Oxford English Dictionary: "empathy, n.". *OED Online*. December 2011. Oxford University Press. `http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/61284`.

† See _Lipps and Nietzsche_ (_Rippusu to Niiche_ [リップスとニイチェ][ja], WTZ 17:167--171), _Lipps’s Individualism_ (_Rippusu no Kojinshugi_ [リップスの個人主義][ja], WTZ 17:172--174), and _Lipps’s Warning_ (_Rippusu no Keikoku_ [リップスの警告][ja], WTZ 17:175--178).

If we reexamine aesthetic experience in light of the importance of empathy to criticism, we find that the "disinterest" of "disinterested enjoyment" refers not to a disinterest in the object, but a disinterest in the prerogatives of the ordinary self. By looking on an object with empathy, we are able to appreciate what is good for the object apart from how the object could be instrumentally good for us. In the moment of ecstatic unity with the object, we do not seek to annihilate it or change it, but delight in its being what it is. It is for this reason that Buddhists and other religious practioners identify the perspective of the non-dual no self (*muga* [無我][ja]) with the gaze of compassion. In the feeling of beauty we get the sense that everything is in its right place and take joy from the dynamic goodness of the object itself. The role of the critic is to form a space in which the ordinary self can be set aside and the perspective of non-duality underlying ordinary experience can be uncovered.

###Individuality and sociality in genius
If criticism is the name we apply to the social pole of creative evolution as double negation, genius is the name of the individual pole of that relationship. However, can we consider genius as a purely individual phenomenon or must we also consider its relationship to a critical milieu?

Kant writes in the _Critique of Judgment_ that, “_Genius_ is the innate mental predisposition (_ingenium_) _through which_ nature gives the rule to art” (Ak. 307). On Kant’s theory, genius is an innate talent in particular individuals to create new rules of taste to match our indeterminate concept of beauty, rather than any communal capacity (though it is through this capacity that communal nature speaks). However, if we examine the concept of genius more closely, we find, as Hegel emphasizes, genius must speak to “the spirit of the times.” For one to paint like Picasso in the Renaissance would not have gotten one far, and to paint like Picasso today is merely to be an imitator. Moreover, as presented in the last chapter, the milieu of a work is not to be neglected. Frank Lloyd Wright's famous house "Fallingwater" would not be a work of genius if reproduced anywhere else in the world. Genius requires an empathic ability to read into the “vital energy” of one’s time and place.

In addition to this ability to read into the existing spirit of things, genius also seems to redirect the course of artistic history. In "The Decay of Lying," Oscar Wilde has an interlocutor remark,

> At present, people see fogs, not because there are fogs, but because poets and painters have taught them the mysterious loveliness of such effects. There may have been fogs for centuries in London. I dare say there were. But no one saw them, and so we do not know anything about them. They did not exist till Art had invented them. (41)

The passage is slightly hyperbolic, but Wilde's basic point is fair. As artistic genius penetrates into a culture, it changes the quality of our aesthetic experiences. Genius reveals to us a world that would have been otherwise invisible, and through the coming together of critical sentiment in aesthetic judgment, our perception is made sharper than it would otherwise be.

Genius reads into the world as it is, changes the world into something, and in addition to this travels from one world to another. A work of genius is born at a particular moment in history within a particular milieu, but it shows its inner genius when it then crosses those contextual boundaries and become a global phenomenon. The greatest artists are those who create global standards for art (think of Picasso who was Spanish by birth but celebrated worldwide) and the greatest works of art are those that function even beyond their original contexts (think of the Venus de Milo, which was originally a religious artifact). 

Examined from this perspective, though genius is the individual pole of critic-genius relationship, it must not be seen as the possession of an individual alone. The _Odyssey_ is clearly a work of genius whether or not it was created by a single individual named Homer. The individuality of genius is a reflection of its ability to create a work with a context inherent within it that spills out into the world of the audience who receive it. This process is “individual” in the sense that genius enriches the private experience of a world that opens up to public criticism. The new world in a work of genius is the crystallization of the historical and climactic conditions of its context of creation but also gives rise to a new space of possibilities above and beyond those conditions. Those great works of art like the Venus de Milo or the paintings of Picasso are great because they bring their ideals with them when they travel and instantly reconfigure the cultures into which they are introduced. Kant claims that genius is the ability to bring a rule of nature to art, but it would be better to see it as the ability to bring an object out of its context by expanding its context in unexpected new directions. What makes genius so fascinating is not just the individual accomplishment of a particular work or object, but the social achievement of an ability to create or alter the existing ethos of an aesthetic community. Genius is made possible by the pre-condition of a certain historical and climactic culture which it expresses, but genius goes beyond its origin to alter the possibility of future aesthetic experiences. Genius reads into its world with empathetic, loving identification, but then causes that empathetic love to spread to others and the world to grow.

Because of the nature of the subject as primarily active and embodied (_shutai_ [主体][ja]) rather than passive and disembodied (_shukan_ [主観][ja]), genius is better understood as a mode of creative activity than as just a form of individual insight. The activity of genius is a kind of “world traveling” in which the genius taps into the non-dual no self (*muga* [無我][ja]) that underlies the separation of the subject and object in ordinary experience. The “empathy” or "love" that makes this kind border crossing possible is an openness to the emptiness (*kū* [空][ja]) of the self and all things. By realizing the emptiness of things, the genius feels the contingency of the current configuration and begins to inhabit a new possibility through a concrete act of self-expression. The self thus expressed is not the ordinary self of everyday experience but the enlarged self of no self. What makes this process possible is the universal emptiness of things. Because all things are empty, there is always going to be more to reality than we can capture in a reduction, hence there will always be new worlds for genius to explore.† Whether we understand parts in terms of the whole or wholes in terms of their parts, such understandings always leave behind a surplus of value available for the genius to creatively appropriate.

† The computer scientist Alan Kay remarks, "All creativity is an extended form of a joke. Most creativity is a transition from one context into another where things are more surprising. There’s an element of surprise, and especially in science, there is often laughter that goes along with the ‘Aha.’ Art also has this element. Our job is to remind us that there are more contexts than the one that we’re in---the one that we think is reality" (Feldman, 29).

The ability of genius to both incorporate and transcend its circumstances in history and milieu is well illustrated by Watsuji in "The Japanese Spirit."† There he looks at the nature of novelty in the development of a people's history. On the one hand,

† “The Japanese Spirit” is _Nihon Seishin_ [日本精神][ja], WTZ 4:281--321, part of _Study of the History of the Japanese Spirit, Continued_, _Zoku Nihon Seishin-Shi Kenkyū_ [続日本精神史研究][ja] (1935). These translations are mine, but compare Dilworth, et al. _Sourcebook for Modern Japanese Philosophy_, 231--61.

> the actualization of Japan's future mission pertains to causing that which has not yet been manifested to be truly and newly manifested. There is no tried and true path for us to grasp what is as yet unmanifested. To employ Bergson's way of speaking, this actualization will be a totally new creation; it must not just be the case of something which has previously appeared as an idea becoming actualized. 

On the other hand,

> The past is something that actively reaches into and engages the future. Just as the future inherits the legacy of past accomplishments, any fundamentally new creation cannot escape the pressure of the past as well.

Watsuji explains his meaning by reference to the work of Michelangelo:

> What was past for him was the legacy of Greek and Roman sculpture. Because he had fully absorbed that legacy, he also understood that he could not break new creative ground by following the same path. He set his focus on a type of beauty that the Greek sculptors had never attempted to see. Let us call this a type of interior beauty, or a spiritual beauty. […]
> A person who stands before this statue of Moses must vividly hear Michelangelo's loud groans as he strove to free himself from the heaviness of the Greek style. The form of humanity he created in his own style in no way expresses the kind of heroic balance and serene dignity that the statues of the Greek gods possess. And yet, that body enfolded in Moses's intricately wrought garments is overwhelmingly felt as a resolute person, one possessed of an absolute will. This is an impression totally unseen in Greek sculpture.

The genius of Michelangelo was his ability to enter into the world of Greek sculpture and bring forth its values in the creation of a new world of his own. His work was not simply a copy of what came before him, but at the same time neither was it a something wholly new. Its novelty lay in the way that he was able create a bridge between worlds, and even today we are able to cross those bridges and travel to the worlds he created.

The activity of crossing from one world into another is valuable because it is this process that uncovers the seams of cleavage in ordinary experience. We feel differences by contrasting them, so movement from one world to another is the only way to uncover the structures that give a world its shape. This is why theory and understanding are so often retroactive rather than prospective. Only once the contrast has been experienced is its meaning clear. Because of this, our search for the most general form of aesthetics must be conducted in and through particulars. Genius creates something particular and great in private, then this private greatness reconfigures the values of the public by communicating this private feeling to each individually as well as to all collectively. To understand this process in greater depth we must next make a detour into the nature of private and public values.

###The public/private distinction
####Totalitarian and liberal extremes
Conceptually, we can distinguish two extreme methods for determining the degree of separation between public and private values. The first extreme is a form of totalitarianism in which public and private values are one. No individual person may possess a value without authorization by the state, and vice versa, values possessed by society as a whole must also be upheld by each person individually. The opposite extreme is a form of liberalism in which private and public values have no intersection. Each individual may possess whatever private values he or she likes, but that individual is forbidden from imposing these private values onto the public as a whole. Vice versa, the public is forbidden from altering the private values of any of its members. What is shared by these caricatures of the totalitarian and liberal positions is a lack of dynamism. The line between the personal and the political is fixed where it is fixed, and there can be no alteration of the line, whether to allow personal latitude in the case of a totalitarian state or to allow public recognition of private feeling in the case of liberalism.

The totalitarian position has the advantage of clarity but the disadvantage of sheer impracticality. Human beings vary in their experiences and beliefs, and so far no sublation of the historical dialectic has yet caused the formation of a total unity of persons. As a result, totalitarian states find themselves constantly faced with the problem of internal dissidents, traitors, and subverters of the public order.

The liberal position has the advantage of practicality but the disadvantage of a certain incoherence. Various attempts have been made to explain where precisely public values originate if not private values, but none of these attempts have been especially convincing. The line between the personal and the political is also subject to much dispute. One frequently seen strategy is to appeal to Thomas Jefferson’s famous aphorism, “it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no God. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg,” and claim that the line between public and private concern may be drawn where private beliefs impose a harm on others in the public. However, there are many privately held convictions about the nature of the world that the state has a public interest in contradicting. (One of the most notable of these is the belief of Christian Scientists that vaccines and medicine are harmful, but it is easy to multiply examples.) Whether such beliefs harm others depends greatly on one's definition of harm and one's conception of the public's justifiable interests. The state is an arrangement of human affairs intended to promote the general welfare, and it is impossible to imagine such an enterprise could be conducted without some shared picture of what the good life or good lives may be.

Against both of these static views of the private-public distinction, I wish to advance a dynamic conception of the private-public distinction that I derive from my reading of Watsuji's work. On my view, the private values of individuals and the public values of societies must be understood through the logic of double negation. Liberalism is correct that there must be a realm reserved for private values that is outside of the scope of public criticism. The first moment of the movement of double negation that sustains human existence is the moment of individuality and without this moment, there would be no truly human life. The attempt to prevent the development of novel private values is an attempt to bring to an end the forward movement of history. Many totalitarian systems explicitly champion this claim---that the end of history is upon us---but if it were so, it would hardly need championing.

On the other hand, the attempt to halt the flow of private values into the public realm as envisioned by some but not all liberal theorists is also damaging to human existence. The moment in which a value can return to society for incorporation into the public as "common sense" has a great importance. To give a few examples from recent Western history, it is impossible to imagine the abolition of slavery, the development of universal suffrage, or the extension of civil rights without a background of strong private moral conviction bleeding into the public realm. The "problem" of Martin Luther King’s religiosity is often mentioned in this discussion. Can we imagine his incredible efficacy at appealing to the sympathies of the American public without reference to the religious nature of that appeal? Private values which are successful are incorporated into the fabric of society and transform the public.

Of course, my purpose in this dissertation is not to debate the nature of the state but to explain the role of the subject and object in aesthetics, but I feel that this explanation would be incomplete without some reference to the dynamic interplay of public and private value feelings in double negation as well as the political implications of Watsujian thinking.  

####Watsuji on the nature of public and private
The first volume of Watsuji's _Study of Ethics_ approaches the public/private distinction from two directions. The first is the direction of publicity entering into private experience. In this section, he studies the dynamic structure of private experience in terms of its spatial and temporal aspects, …

> Publicity consists of its not being hidden from the public; that is, of the possibility of everyone participating in coming to know something. If persons are able to participate in existence, and can share (mit-teilen) it with one another, then this existence is public. (150)

> It follows that private existence is also **something essentially public**, but this only goes so far as it possesses the mode of _privatus_. WTZ10:153

> And so, history moves forward, not by hidden true aspects (真相), but by publicity. WTZ10:159

That is, the advance into creative novelty sought in aesthetics and elsewhere depends crucially on the making public of values.


> The publicity that hid Socrates' greatness was also that by which his greatness was disclosed. Thus, publicity covers the truth of things and, at the same time, discovers or reveals it. (151)


####Whitehead's Burkean Jacobinism
∞ = Double Negation

For Whitehead, religion is both "a thoroughly social phenomenon"[^] and "what 
the individual does with his solitariness."[^] The reason for this paradox is 
that religion is the outcome of a social process by which individuals have 
attempt to concretize what is most abstract. It is a way for the individual to 
grasp the general through the particularity of one's personal, individual 
experience. This makes religion philosophically significant both as a source 
of experiential data and as a prompt that allows the individual to grasp the 
more abstract aspects of experience:

[^]: _Religion_, p. 27.
[^]: _Ibid_., p. 47. _Religion_, p. 16 has a similar quote but with "his *own* solitariness" (emphasis mine) substituted. 

> Religion is the translation of general ideas into particular thoughts, 
particular emotions, and particular purposes; it is directed to the end of 
stretching individual interest beyond its self-defeating particularity. 
Philosophy finds religion and modifies it; and conversely religion is among 
the data of experience which philosophy must weave into its own scheme.[^]
[^]: _Process_, 23.

From this we can see that a philosophy that merely dismisses religion without 
adequately investigating the nature of religious experiences discards an 
important source of information about the world.

The chief danger for religion is dogmatism:

> A dogma--in the sense of a precise statement--can never be final; it can 
only be adequate in its adjustment of certain abstract concepts. […]
>
> […] A dogma may be true in the sense that it expresses such interrelations 
of the subject matter as are expressible within the set of ideas employed. But 
if the same dogma be used intolerantly so as to check the employment of other 
modes of analyzing the subject matter, then, for all its truth, it will be 
doing the work of falsehood.[^]
[^]: _Religion_, p. 131.

Unlike a dogmatic religion, a rational religion organizes its rituals and 
beliefs into "a coherent ordering of life" that both "elucidates thought" and 
commands "ethical approval."[^] What makes a religion rational is its ability 
to resist the impulse to dogmatism, to continually make its truth new through 
the reorganization of its symbolic relations. When a religion refuses to adapt 
its symbolism to changes in the experience of life, it is liable to both 
stifle thought and commit ethical atrocities.

[^]: _Ibid_., p. 31.

While religion must continually be critiqued so as to prune away its harmful 
dogmas, this is by no means a smooth process. Changes in the symbolic order 
always dangerous, such that

> It is not therefore true that any advance in the scale of culture inevitably 
tends to the preservation of society. On the whole, the contrary tends more 
often to be the case, and any survey of nature confirms this conclusion.[^]

[^]: _Symbolism_, p. 69.

For this reason, Whitehead deliberately compares his view of social change to 
Burke, stating that Burke "was right in his premises and wrong in his 
conclusions."[^] Burke was right to think that social "progress," so-called, 
often leads to the destruction of the society that embraces it, as was the 
case in the French Revolution. Burke was wrong to think that as a result such 
revolutions must be avoided at all costs. For Whitehead, there is something to 
be said for both the path of the iconodule and the path of the iconoclast: 

[^]: _Ibid_., p. 71.

> There is a greatness in the lives of those who build up religious systems, a 
greatness in action, in idea, and in self-subordination, embodied in instance 
after instance through centuries of growth. There is a greatness in the rebels 
who destroy such systems[…].[^]
[^]: _Process_, 513.

What makes both paths productive is that they both lead to the building up of 
a more complex, responsive system able to take in new abstractions and enjoy 
the beautiful harmony of new contrasts. Symbolism is always "dangerous," since 
it "may involve an arbitrary imputation of unsuitable characters."[^] Still, 
this danger is worth it, since it is the cost of higher consciousness. In the 
end, 

[^]: _Symbolism_, p. 87.
> The art of the free society consists first in the maintenance of the 
symbolic code; and secondly in the fearlessness of revision, to secure that 
the code serves those purposes which satisfy an enlightened reason. Those 
societies which cannot combine reverence to their symbols with freedom of 
revision, must ultimately decay either from anarchy, or from the slow atrophy 
of a life stifled by useless shadows.[^]
[^]: _Ibid_., p. 88.

###Idols and artifacts
Watsuji's critics often contend that his system subordinates religion in the service of the state. These criticism are not without merit but must placed within the broader context of Watsuji’s life and career. In his earliest years, he followed the English Romantics, Bernard Shaw, and even Nietzsche in rejecting religion as an outmoded influence on society, but as time went on he began to reconsider its importance. By the time of his _Revival of the Idols_∞ (1918), Watsuji had begun to understand religion as an important determinant in the evolution of culture. Where for Nietzsche “idols” represent congealments of life that ought to be destroyed, Watsuji saw also their positive role in the progression of life. “The Psychology of Idol Worship”∞ is an essay in RoI where Watsuji explores the mindset of those Japanese who first accepted the foreign importation of Buddhism to Japan. In it, Watsuji writes,

> What especially catches the eye is that they demanded artistic joy (*geijutsu-teki na kanki* [芸術的な歓喜][ja]) from religion. Going further than that, they tied their faith to this sensuous joy. The former is proved by the great art that was born of the Nara period. The latter is unquestionably proven by several prominent social phenomena which manifest how much power the priests of that era held over the human body. These characteristics may have varied in form to some degree but are surely apparent in every religion that has since been born in Japan. […] This close melding of art and religion is able to provide an extremely justified ground for idol worship. (∞)

In other words, the ancient Japanese came to accept Buddhism as a religion first because of their love of the aesthetic, artistic joy it provided, which they expressed through the religious experience of idol worship. In that context, "Art appreciation and religious conversion were one" (∞). As a result, "Just as art appreciation develops its root sources out of the inner life of its makers, so idol veneration also develops from the inner life of idol makers" (∞). Watsuji describes the strong aesthetic experience of distancing and dissolution that the early Japanese Buddhist adherents would have had listening to chanting of the monks:

> Those who were intoxicated (_tōsui_ [陶酔][ja]) on music would sometimes open their enchanted eyes and gaze on the heavenly idols. They had already lost consciousness of themselves. They had already integrated the idols into their hearts, and in an infinity of gratitude and blessings they experienced an intense shining and a nimbleness of the whole heart.---Actually, their agitated hearts were extremely sensitive toward the statues and music. The strength and chiaroscuro of that inner life was no different in its extreme intensity of feeling, though it could not be called well defined. When all of their artistic results and religious influences were concentrated on just one point, that is, the veneration of idols, especially as in the aforementioned circumstances, the depth and strength of that ecstasy (_uchōten_ [有頂天][ja]) seems to be almost beyond our imaginations. In this way, our ancestors had tasted one kind of aesthetico-religious great joy (_bi-teki shūkyō-teki na dai-kanki_ [美的宗教的な大歓喜][ja]) in idol worship. (∞)

While a strong influence from Nietzsche is apparent in this passage, we also see the beginnings of unique understanding of the relationship between private religious and aesthetic sentiments and public social conditions. Watsuji shows that the rigid structure and rules of Buddhism, anathema to the Dionysian Nietzsche, have provided the space in which the Japanese devotees can experience an aesthetic rapture together. The rapture of the monks was made possible first by their commitment to detachment from the world, which was the precondition of their losing themselves to the world. Though Buddhism took root on the strength of its connection between aesthetic experience and religious experience, nevertheless, it brought a political and social meaning that was to transform Japan:

> The temple of that time was a treasure hall of culture as seen from perhaps any perspective. They were not merely places for the monasticism and discipline of an ascetic lifestyle. Rather, its chief content was the whole of scholarship, artistry, self-cultivation, and so on. It was one place that contained all kinds of spiritual nourishment, as if a university, a theater, an art school, a museum, a music school, a concert hall, a library, and a monastery had all been rolled into one. There the priests heard the sutras containing the Buddha's lectures on philosophical principles as symbolical poetry. As they became familiar with those legendary, highly symbolic expressions, they connected those lectures with the statues and images of the Buddha that concretized them. (∞)

Here we see that the private aesthetic and religious feelings that swept over the primitive Japanese ended up causing a wholesale reordering of the public. The Buddhist idols had a kind of genius to them that brought with them the power to restructure the world of the Japanese. 

Unlike Nietzsche's theory of *[ressentiment][fr]*, however, as Watsuji portrays it, this restructuring is not the cause of the loss of a more authentic nobility but a deepening of the self-understanding of the Japanese people. Watsuji finds in Buddhism an appreciation for the importance of experiencing the flow of life unimpeded by conceptual congealing similar to Nietzsche's, and this leads Watsuji to see the positive value of idols, both literal and conceptual. Where Nietzsche casually sneers at the inauthenticity of Buddhism’s life negating tendencies (it is guilty of “denying the will” and “longing for nothingness”[^]), Watsuji began to appreciate life affirming aspect of self-negation in the face of an awesome aesthetic other. Nietzsche was only aware of a caricatured portrait of South Asian non-Mahāyāna Buddhism, but Watsuji was thoroughly acquainted with both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna Buddhism, which gave him a better perspective on the ways in which Buddhism could be life affirming and embrace aesthetic experience. While both Watsuji and Nietzsche emphasize the importance of intoxication to the opening of the self to the Dionysian joy of aesthetic/religious ecstasy, Watsuji also begins to sympathize with the veneration of the idols as well, which is an act that would strike Nietzsche as servile and a betrayal of the will to power. As David B. Gordon argues, however, the common thread connecting Watsuji’s work before and after _A Study of Nietzsche_ is Watsuji’s recognition of the overcoming of self as the means of expressing the authenticity of the self.∞FOOTNOTE FOR GORDON.

In his preface to _Revival of the Idols_ ∞, Watsuji expands the themes of the essays in the collection by illustrating his point with the story of the Apostle Paul. According to Watsuji, Paul was disgusted by the Dionysian excesses of the ancient Athenians, and managed to so impress them with his disdain for idolatry that a period of iconoclasm followed for the better part of two millennia. Watsuji allows that this was for the best historically, and yet we cannot wholly rid ourselves of the idols:

> There is no need at this time to repeat that iconoclasm, or the destruction of idols, is indispensable as a way for life to progress. The flow of life is maintained by this path [*michi* 道] alone. Idols, which we unceasingly construct in our subconsciouses, must be destroyed by careful and unceasing effort.
>
> And yet, it is not that these idols are created without meaning. They ought to give a strength that has unity in the flow of life and guide the growth of life toward a healthy abundance and beauty. This is the indispensable duty which they have in our way of life. Stuck without them between the confusion of consciousness and the division of desires, a person will end up stunted. It is possible that some will even go so far as treating "nihility" [*kyomu* 虚無] as an idol in order to be able to lead a life of positivity. (∞)

What finally brought an end to the era of iconoclasm in the West was a literal return of the idols of the past. Ancient Greek and Roman statues were restored to positions of honor in society. However, their new position was by no means identical to what it had been before the period of iconoclasm:

> Nevertheless, idols that have been revived are no longer gods deserving of veneration. No one thought to offer before them a beast in sacrifice. No one thought to entrust his own fate into the hands of these idols. What caused the people tremble was not their being heretical gods but their beauty. Paul's expulsion of idols is something that should have been accepted as a matter of course only to the degree that the idols were taken to be gods for veneration. However, as works of art which are venerated for their beauty, the idols were offered unfair treatment by Paul. Now that unfair treatment is being recompensed, and the idols are seen by the people as possessing a dignity even as mere works of art. (∞)

In other words, statues like the Venus de Milo continue to possess a kind of awe inspiring power, but we no longer feel that power to be a religious one, but primarily an artistic one. The meaning of its genius has been transmuted. It still contains a world within itself, but this world is now a secular one. This shows at the same time, the change brought about in the status of religion and the change in the status of art. New iconoclasts in the form of anti-clerical and even atheistic movements had taken root in the West, but their iconoclasm could not be total. So soon as they suppressed God, they found that they had to put “Art” on a pedestal. Watsuji writes,

> The Christian "God" is also a kind of idol. Paul expelled idols made by "the hands of men." The modern iconoclasts expelled gods made by "the heads of men." However, just as Paul could not completely purge the idols, the modern iconoclasts were also unable to completely purge God. Even after the much-discussed pronouncement that "God is dead,” a god-seeking heart stealthily takes root in the breast of the people.
>
> […]

> Though we have lost the name of God, nevertheless we cannot refrain from searching for a new name to give Him. Should we call Him "the Will”? Ought we to speak of Him as "the Absolute"? Or might we call Him "the Electron” as well? Perhaps these names ought to be cast out by a new Paul as demonic gods. We have built an altar to "the Unknown God" and await the appearance of a Paul that can clearly preach about God to us. And so we anticipate the destruction of all of the idols created by the spirit of modernity. (∞)

For his part, Watsuji sees both iconoclasm and idol worship as necessary moments in a process of historical unfolding. Neither can exist without the other, because they both bring us closer to discovering the hidden depths of the ordinary. The “god” that we seek is the unknown and unknowable, hence any attempt we make to absolutize the public over the private or vice versa must fail. Our private vision of the good must spill into public life without thereby becoming 
THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE REALMS ARE LOCKED IN…∞
There is a mysterious profundity in how things are on their own that is overlooked by ordinary consciousness but which we can recover when we use aesthetic awareness to alert us to the ecstatic interiority of things:

> I preach the path of righteousness. I suppose some will call this banal. I, however, am talking about the joy of discovering new life in the banal. I am trying to tell you about the sweetness of the nectar secreted away inside the shell of the banal. As for the banal--fixed ideas that are taken to have no life--we needs must first shake the dulled senses out of their sleep by waking (_satoru_ [悟る][ja]) the shell itself and then wield an iron hammer to break it apart. The eyes of new senses will for the first time be awakened to the revival of the idols. 
>
> I do not, however, merely aim to "resurrect the old." When the old is raised up again, the old shell is cast off and a new life shines forth. The fetters of time no longer apply in this new life. It is eternally young, eternally new. My aim is in this way to extoll the eternally present life. I feel a presentiment of a great path that converges in the heart of all idols. And I feel that all human efforts, past and future, will at the last be gathered in the direction of this path. ∞

Thus we see that for the early Watsuji, religion is not just a means of ethnic self-expression whereby the state comes to enlist higher ideals for its legitimation. At its best, religion is a means to aesthetic appreciation of the eternal in every moment. The difficulty is that over time religions inevitably evolve into mere “idol worship” and must be smashed by iconoclasm so that the innate impulse to religiosity can find new and better ways of expressing itself without being stifled by frozen conceptions of how things ought to be. While this understanding of religion does not make up for the shortcomings of Watsuji’s later “idolization” of the state, it helps put into perspective how such idolization came about, in that he came to identify the state with that power which drives the cycle of idolization and iconoclasm forward.

###Conclusion
  - Museums are the one place where religion, nationalism, and aesthetics come together. Museums are substitute temples and often get filled with religious artifacts. They glorify their home nations either for plundering other people or for creating stuff itself. Cf. Heidegger’s theory of a work of art as temple based.
