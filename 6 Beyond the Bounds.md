##Chapter 6. Beyond the Bounds of Aesthetics: Criticism, Genius, and Culture

###Deconstructing aesthetics
In this dissertation, I have attempted to apply the anthropology and methodology of [Watsuji][sc] Tetsurō to aesthetics. The final step in this hermeneutic process is to deconstruct aesthetics into its most general components. How is hermeneutic destruction possible? As Watsuji writes in _Study of Ethics_, “self-awareness (_jikaku_ [自覚][ja]) of particularity is the only path (*michi* [道][ja]) by which to go beyond particularities” (WTZ 10:49). Abstract theory must be grounded on the basis of concrete experience. One particular experience will be the key for this chapter. That experience is the experience of genius, that is, the experience of works which go beyond the boundaries of the particular contexts of their creation and spread over space and time.

As the title “[Watsuji][sc] Tetsurō and the Subject of Aesthetics” implies, I have primarily focused on the importance of subjective factors in aesthetics. Aesthetic experience is a matter of a subject’s disinterested enjoyment. Aesthetic judgment requires subjects to come together to assess the fullness of the object. Theories of art must account for the context in which subjects encounter art objects. However, I hope I have also shown something of the importance of the object itself. Works of genius certainly show us that this importance is not to be slighted. These works carry new worlds with them and invite us to enter into them.
They speak to us across the chasm of historical and climactic difference by bringing a context with them.

Before we can look directly at the question of how works of genius are able to carry a world with them it is necessary to look at the context of this world traveling. In other words, we need to look at the nature of criticism itself. In a certain sense, a critic must be a lover. Put in less provocative terms, critics must be able to feel a pure empathy for the work under consideration and convey this empathetic attitude to others.

Once we understand the role of the critic, we may ask about the role of geniuses in society. Is the genius an individual opposed to all social restraint? Or is genius a crystallized expression of the structure of a particular society? Paradoxically, in opposing society, the genius expresses its highest significance. This is why genius is able to push the boundaries of society forward. To grasp this process, we must see how it is that private values are exteriorized into society and vice-versa, how public values are internalized and felt subjectively. An examination of this process leads us to reevaluate the false choice presented between a liberal society in which public and private values are fixed in permanent division and a totalitarian society in which no distinction between public and private values is made.

Finally, I wish to conclude with a concrete discussion of Murasaki Shikibu [紫式部][ja], a genius of Japanese literature and author of *The Tale of Genji* (*Genji Monogatari* [源氏物語][ja]), as well as the critics who were vital to our reception of her work.

###Criticism and empathy
Both individuality and sociality are necessary for artistic creation. In the distant past it may have been that these two aspects of artistic creation were not well distinguished, but now at least, the social side of this process has been institutionalized as “criticism.” Let us refer to the individual side of the process as “genius.” Artistic creativity comes from the intersection of genius and criticism as a double negation. The artist may retreat to the studio alone to create a work, but when the work is done it must be presented to the public for appreciation. Without some individuality, there would be no novelty to the work. It would only present the preexistent ideas of the group. On the other hand, without sociality there could be no individuality. The ideas that the individual creatively enhances come from the group and must return to the group if they are to have any future efficacy. The works of the individual require the group for its evaluation. Genius, however radical and new it may be, is always an extension of existing art history, and purported genius that does not affect the future growth of art history is not true genius.

Naturally, part of the project of criticism will be negative: we define ourselves as a group by excluding what it is that we reject. We hate this; we reject this; we find this vulgar. But there is also a positive side to criticism: we embrace certain objects and are united by our shared values. We love this; we accept this; we find this refined. These two aspects of criticism are important but inward facing. The works themselves, to the extent they matter, matter only insofar as they promote or hinder our unity as a critical community. A full account of criticism must also strive to understand why works come to possess the power to unite or divide critics.

One approach to the criticism of art work is to be critical, that is, to criticize. One can search the object closely for faults in order to seize on them and present them to its creator and others. This attitude, however, is clearly of more use in fostering one’s reputation among fellow connoisseurs than it is for allowing one to aesthetically engage with the object. It has its place, but it is not strictly aesthetic insofar as it cuts off the possibility of engagement with the object.

In a short essay entitled “Art Criticism” (_Geijutsu Hihyō_ [芸術批評][ja]), Watsuji explains the approach of the French philosopher Jean-Marie Guyau (1854--1888) to criticism and his own. Both are opposed to the brand of criticism that seeks only to tear down. Watsuji interprets Guyau’s view as being, “one who we ought to call a critic is one who best sings praises to the beautiful and also one best able to explain this praise to others” (WTZ 17:189). While agreeing with this sentiment, Watsuji feels that we must not lose sight of the source of criticizing criticism either. In his view, “The ideal critic knows best how to praise beauty, while also being at the same time the most sensitive towards the ugly” (WTZ 17:190). When the critic criticizes, it should not be out of a desire to impress others with one’s snobbish sophistication, but out of a sensitivity to the ways that object came so close to achieving greatness but fell short.

The attitude a critic must possess in order to simultaneously praise the beautiful and criticize the bad is, Watsuji and Guyau agree, love. Love, of course, can be understood in many ways beyond even the traditional Greek distinctions between *agapé* <!--[ἀγάπη][el]--> (“charitable love”), *eros* <!--[ἔρως][el]--> (“erotic love”), *philia* <!--[φιλία][el]--> (“brotherly love”), and *storgé* <!--[στοργή][el]--> (“familial affection”). To add in distinctions from the East Asian tradition, we might also mention [慈悲][zh] (Ch. _cibei_, Jp. _jihi_, “compassion”),  [戀][zh] (Ch. *lian*, Jp. _koi_, “yearning love”), [愛][zh] (Ch. _ai_, Jp. _ai_, “possessive love”), and [仁][zh] (Ch. _ren_, Jp. _jin_, “humane conduct”). Each of these concepts of love has a different shade of meaning that has evolved historically and each reveals a different aspect of the attitude needed for aesthetic judgment, but the thread that runs through them as concepts is the sense of outward yearning concern.

In _Study of Ethics_, Watsuji mentions one view of love given by Hegel (WTZ 10:87). I believe Hegel captures something common to our conceptions of love in his _Philosophy of Right_:

> Love is in general the consciousness of the unity of myself with another. I am not separate and isolated, but win my self-consciousness only by renouncing my independent existence, and by knowing myself as unity of myself with another and of another with me. […] The first element in love is that I will to be no longer an independent self-sufficing person, and that, if I were such a person, I should feel myself lacking and incomplete. The second element is that I gain myself in another person, in whom I am recognized, as he again is in me. Hence love is the most tremendous contradiction, incapable of being solved by the understanding. Nothing is more obstinate than this scrupulosity of self-consciousness, which, though negated, I yet insist upon as something positive. Love is both the source and solution of this contradiction. As a solution it is an ethical union. (§158, 139)

Watsuji summarizes, “love is the contradiction that to abandon oneself is to acquire oneself” (WTZ 10:88). For the purposes of understanding aesthetic judgment, what love must mean is one’s identity as a subject requires a willingness to go beyond one’s horizons while accepting the otherness of the object. That is, love desires the other without needing to possess it or smother it. To the contrary, the lover finds herself only by losing herself to the beloved. The feeling of disinterested enjoyment rests on just this. 

In Plato’s _Symposium_, Aristophanes tells a myth about the origin of love. Once, human beings were wholes with four arms, four legs, and two faces, but now we have been divided into halves as punishment by the gods. As a result, we spend our lives searching for our lives in search of a lover to complete us, that is, searching for our other halves:

> Why should this be so? It’s because, as I said, we used to be complete wholes in our original nature, and now “Love” is the name for our pursuit of wholeness, for our desire to be complete. (192e)

The form of love that makes criticism possible is similar in that it too is a drive to reunify in cleavage what was originally together without division. In criticism, we are not just looking for another person to complete us, but for oneness with the emptiness out of which subject and object co-arise. This return with difference is the foundation of aesthetic goodness and the drive that compels our experiences to evolve in progressively novel forms.

To be sure, an overemphasis on the word “love” as the attitude of the critic can lead to a misunderstanding of what aesthetic judgment calls for. Again, the critic must always be ready to criticize the ugliness of the ugly. While this is compatible with a deeper understanding of love, it easily becomes obscured if our concept of love is too shallow. Another way of conceptualizing the attitude needed for aesthetic judgment that may prevent this misunderstanding is as empathy. The word “empathy” was coined as a translation of the German *[Einfühlung][de]*, which was popularized by German philosopher Theodor Lipps (1851--1914).† Watsuji mentions Lipps in his unfinished notes on art theory and wrote about him several times in _Revival of the Idols_ (1918).† The German *[Einfühlung][de]* and the Greco-English “empathy” are both compounds meaning “in feeling.” The preposition “in” suggest that while outside the thing being empathized with, we nevertheless enter into it ecstatically. We feel from our position as subjects into the position of the object. In doing so, we come together with our fellow appreciators, the artist, and---most importantly---the object itself.

† See the etymology of empathy presented in the Oxford English Dictionary: “empathy, n.”. *OED Online*. December 2011. Oxford University Press. `http://www.oed.com/viewdictionaryentry/Entry/61284`.

† _Revival of the Idols_ is _Guzō Saikō_ [偶像再興][ja] (WTZ 17:1--284), a collection of short essays by Watsuji. See _Lipps and Nietzsche_ (_Rippusu to Niiche_ [リップスとニイチェ][ja], WTZ 17:167--171), _Lipps’s Individualism_ (_Rippusu no Kojinshugi_ [リップスの個人主義][ja], WTZ 17:172--174), and _Lipps’s Warning_ (_Rippusu no Keikoku_ [リップスの警告][ja], WTZ 17:175--178).

If we reexamine aesthetic experience in light of the importance of empathy to criticism, we find that the “disinterest” of “disinterested enjoyment” refers not to a disinterest in the object, but a disinterest in the prerogatives of the ordinary self. By looking on an object with empathy, we are able to appreciate what is good for the object apart from how the object could be instrumentally good for us. In the moment of ecstatic unity with the object, we do not seek to annihilate it or change it, but delight in its being what it is. It is for this reason that Buddhists and other religious practioners identify the perspective of the non-dual no self (*muga* [無我][ja]) with the gaze of compassion. In the feeling of beauty we get the sense that everything is in its right place and take joy from the dynamic goodness of the object itself. The role of the critic is to form a space in which the ordinary self can be set aside and the perspective of non-duality underlying ordinary experience can be uncovered.

###Individuality and sociality in genius
If criticism is the name we apply to the social pole of creative evolution as double negation, genius is the name of the individual pole of that relationship. However, can we consider genius as a purely individual phenomenon or must we also consider its relationship to a critical milieu?

Kant writes in the _Critique of Judgment_ that, “_Genius_ is the innate mental predisposition (_ingenium_) _through which_ nature gives the rule to art” (Ak. 307). On Kant’s theory, genius is an innate talent in particular individuals to create new rules of taste to match our indeterminate concept of beauty, rather than any communal capacity (though it is through this capacity that communal nature speaks). However, if we examine the concept of genius more closely, we find, as Hegel emphasizes, genius must speak to “the spirit of the times.” For one to paint like Picasso in the Renaissance would not have gotten one far, and to paint like Picasso today is merely to be an imitator. Moreover, as presented in the last chapter, the milieu of a work is not to be neglected. Frank Lloyd Wright’s famous house “Fallingwater” would not be a work of genius if reproduced anywhere else in the world. Genius requires an empathic ability to read into the “vital energy” of one’s time and place.

In addition to this ability to read into the existing spirit of things, genius also seems to redirect the course of artistic history. In “The Decay of Lying,” Oscar Wilde has an interlocutor remark,

> At present, people see fogs, not because there are fogs, but because poets and painters have taught them the mysterious loveliness of such effects. There may have been fogs for centuries in London. I dare say there were. But no one saw them, and so we do not know anything about them. They did not exist till Art had invented them. (41)

The passage is slightly hyperbolic, but Wilde’s basic point is fair. As artistic genius penetrates into a culture, it changes the quality of our aesthetic experiences. Genius reveals to us a world that would have been otherwise invisible, and through the coming together of critical sentiment in aesthetic judgment, our perception is made sharper than it would otherwise be.

Genius reads into the world as it is, changes the world into something, and in addition to this travels from one world to another. A work of genius is born at a particular moment in history within a particular milieu, but it shows its inner genius when it then crosses those contextual boundaries and become a global phenomenon. The greatest artists are those who create global standards for art (think of Picasso who was Spanish by birth but celebrated worldwide) and the greatest works of art are those that function even beyond their original contexts (think of the Venus de Milo, which was originally a religious artifact). 

Examined from this perspective, though genius is the individual pole of critic-genius relationship, it must not be seen as the possession of an individual alone. The _Odyssey_ is clearly a work of genius whether or not it was created by a single individual named Homer. The individuality of genius is a reflection of its ability to create a work with a context inherent within it that spills out into the world of the audience who receive it. This process is “individual” in the sense that genius enriches the private experience of a world that opens up to public criticism. The new world in a work of genius is the crystallization of the historical and climactic conditions of its context of creation but also gives rise to a new space of possibilities above and beyond those conditions. Those great works of art like the Venus de Milo or the paintings of Picasso are great because they bring their ideals with them when they travel and instantly reconfigure the cultures into which they are introduced. Kant claims that genius is the ability to bring a rule of nature to art, but it would be better to see it as the ability to bring an object out of its context by expanding its context in unexpected new directions. What makes genius so fascinating is not just the individual accomplishment of a particular work or object, but the social achievement of an ability to create or alter the existing ethos of an aesthetic community. Genius is made possible by the pre-condition of a certain historical and climactic culture which it expresses, but genius goes beyond its origin to alter the possibility of future aesthetic experiences. Genius reads into its world with empathetic, loving identification, but then causes that empathetic love to spread to others and the world to grow.

Because of the nature of the subject as primarily active and embodied (_shutai_ [主体][ja]) rather than passive and disembodied (_shukan_ [主観][ja]), genius is better understood as a mode of creative activity than as just a form of individual insight. The activity of genius is a kind of “world traveling” in which the genius taps into the non-dual no self (*muga* [無我][ja]) that underlies the separation of the subject and object in ordinary experience. The “empathy” or “love” that makes this kind border crossing possible is an openness to the emptiness (*kū* [空][ja]) of the self and all things. By realizing the emptiness of things, the genius feels the contingency of the current configuration and begins to inhabit a new possibility through a concrete act of self-expression. The self thus expressed is not the ordinary self of everyday experience but the enlarged self of no self. What makes this process possible is the universal emptiness of things. Because all things are empty, there is always going to be more to reality than we can capture in a reduction, hence there will always be new worlds for genius to explore.† Whether we understand parts in terms of the whole or wholes in terms of their parts, such understandings always leave behind a surplus of value available for the genius to creatively appropriate.

† The computer scientist Alan Kay remarks, “All creativity is an extended form of a joke. Most creativity is a transition from one context into another where things are more surprising. There’s an element of surprise, and especially in science, there is often laughter that goes along with the ‘Aha.’ Art also has this element. Our job is to remind us that there are more contexts than the one that we’re in---the one that we think is reality” (Feldman, 29).

The ability of genius to both incorporate and transcend its circumstances in history and milieu is well illustrated by Watsuji in “The Japanese Spirit.”† There he looks at the nature of novelty in the development of a people’s history. On the one hand,

† “The Japanese Spirit” is _Nihon Seishin_ [日本精神][ja], WTZ 4:281--321, part of _Study of the History of the Japanese Spirit, Continued_, _Zoku Nihon Seishin-Shi Kenkyū_ [続日本精神史研究][ja] (1935). These translations are mine, but compare Dilworth, et al. _Sourcebook for Modern Japanese Philosophy_, 231--61.

> the actualization of Japan’s future mission pertains to causing that which has not yet been manifested to be truly and newly manifested. There is no tried and true path for us to grasp what is as yet unmanifested. To employ Bergson’s way of speaking, this actualization will be a totally new creation; it must not just be the case of something which has previously appeared as an idea becoming actualized. 

On the other hand,

> The past is something that actively reaches into and engages the future. Just as the future inherits the legacy of past accomplishments, any fundamentally new creation cannot escape the pressure of the past as well.

Watsuji explains his meaning by reference to the work of Michelangelo:

> What was past for him was the legacy of Greek and Roman sculpture. Because he had fully absorbed that legacy, he also understood that he could not break new creative ground by following the same path. He set his focus on a type of beauty that the Greek sculptors had never attempted to see. Let us call this a type of interior beauty, or a spiritual beauty. […]
> A person who stands before this statue of Moses must vividly hear Michelangelo’s loud groans as he strove to free himself from the heaviness of the Greek style. The form of humanity he created in his own style in no way expresses the kind of heroic balance and serene dignity that the statues of the Greek gods possess. And yet, that body enfolded in Moses’s intricately wrought garments is overwhelmingly felt as a resolute person, one possessed of an absolute will. This is an impression totally unseen in Greek sculpture.

The genius of Michelangelo was his ability to enter into the world of Greek sculpture and bring forth its values in the creation of a new world of his own. His work was not simply a copy of what came before him, but at the same time neither was it a something wholly new. Its novelty lay in the way that he was able create a bridge between worlds, and even today we are able to cross those bridges and travel to the worlds he created.

The activity of crossing from one world into another is valuable because it is this process that uncovers the seams of cleavage in ordinary experience. We feel differences by contrasting them, so movement from one world to another is the only way to uncover the structures that give a world its shape. This is why theory and understanding are so often retroactive rather than prospective. Only once the contrast has been experienced is its meaning clear. Because of this, our search for the most general form of aesthetics must be conducted in and through particulars. Genius creates something particular and great in private, then this private greatness reconfigures the values of the public by communicating this private feeling to each individually as well as to all collectively. To understand this process in greater depth we must next make a detour into the nature of private and public values.

###The public/private distinction
####Totalitarian and liberal extremes
Conceptually, we can distinguish two extreme methods for determining the degree of separation between public and private values. The first extreme is a form of totalitarianism in which public and private values are one. No individual person may possess a value without authorization by the state, and vice versa, the values endorsed by society as a whole must also be upheld by each person individually. The opposite extreme is a form of liberalism in which private and public values have no intersection. Each individual may possess whatever private values he or she likes, but that individual is forbidden from imposing these private values onto the public as a whole, and, vice versa, the public is forbidden from altering the private values of any of its members. What is shared by these caricatures of totalitarian and liberal positions is a lack of dynamism. The line between the personal and the political is fixed where it is fixed, and there can be no alteration of the line, whether to allow more personal latitude in the case of a totalitarian state or to allow public recognition of private feeling in the case of liberalism.

The totalitarian extreme has the advantage of clarity but the disadvantage of sheer impracticality. Human beings vary in their experiences and beliefs, and so far no sublation of the historical dialectic has yet caused the formation of a total unity of persons. As a result, totalitarian states find themselves constantly faced with the problem of internal dissidents, traitors, and subverters of the public order.

The liberal extreme has the advantage of practicality but the disadvantage of a certain incoherence. Various attempts have been made to explain where precisely public values originate if not private values, but none of these attempts have been especially convincing. The exact position of the line separating the personal and the political is also subject to much dispute. One frequently seen strategy is to appeal to Thomas Jefferson’s famous aphorism, “it does me no injury for my neighbor to say there are twenty gods or no God. It neither picks my pocket nor breaks my leg,” and claim that the line between public and private concern may be drawn where private beliefs impose a harm on others in the public. However, there are many privately held convictions about the nature of the world that the state has a public interest in contradicting. (One of the most notable of these is the belief of Christian Scientists that vaccines and medicine are harmful, but it is easy to multiply examples.) Whether such beliefs harm others depends greatly on one’s definition of harm and one’s conception of the public’s justifiable interests. The state is an arrangement of human affairs that gains legitimacy through its promotion of the general welfare, and it is impossible to imagine such an enterprise could be conducted without some shared picture of what the good life or good lives may be.

Against both of these static views of the private-public distinction, I wish to advance a dynamic conception of the private-public distinction that I derive from my reading of Watsuji’s work. On my view, the private values of individuals and the public values of societies must be understood through the logic of double negation. Liberalism is correct that there must be a realm reserved for private values that is outside of the scope of public criticism. The first moment of the movement of double negation is the moment of individuality and without this moment, there would be no truly human life. The attempt to prevent the development of novel private values is an attempt to bring to an end the forward movement of history. Many totalitarian systems explicitly champion this claim---that the end of history is upon us---but if it were so, it would hardly need championing. The preservation of a space in which private thoughts, beliefs, values, and feelings can be nurtured is essential to the well-ordering of society.

On the other hand, the attempt to halt the flow of private values into the public realm as envisioned by some but not all liberal theorists can also be damaging to human existence if taken too far. The moment in which a value can return to society for incorporation into the public as “common sense” has a great importance. To give a few examples from recent American history, it is impossible to imagine the abolition of slavery, the development of universal suffrage, or the extension of civil rights without a background of strong private moral conviction bleeding into the public realm. The “problem” of Martin Luther King’s religiosity is often mentioned in this discussion. Can we imagine his incredible efficacy at appealing to the sympathies of the American public without reference to the religious nature of that appeal? Private values which are successful become incorporated into the fabric of society and transform the public.

Of course, my purpose in this dissertation is not to debate the nature of the state but to explain the role of the subject and object in aesthetics, but I feel that this explanation would be incomplete without some reference to the dynamic interplay of public and private value feelings in double negation as well as the political implications of Watsujian thinking. Aesthetic genius depends critically on the ability of private and public values to interchange.

####Watsuji on the nature of public and private
The first volume of Watsuji’s _Study of Ethics_ approaches the public/private distinction from two directions. The first is to explain the private experience of time and space in terms of public experiences like communication, news, and so (WTZ 10:152--62). The second is to explain the public experiences of various social structures (couples, families, cultures, states, etc.) in terms of the private experience of solidarity (WTZ 10:330--36).

Important to understanding Watsuji’s anthropology is the concept of the social realm or _seken_ [世間][ja]. As in word _ningen_ (“human”), the character [間][ja] conveys a spatial or temporal interval, but what is interesting is that [世][ja] (also read _yo_ when written in isolation) is likewise both spatial and temporal. _Yo_ indicates either the world (spatial) or a generation (temporal). (A property once shared by “world” in English and *[Welt][de]* in German but lost over time.) _Seken_ plays a role in Watsuji’s philosophy similar to that played by “the They” (*[das Man][de]*) in Heidegger, but unlike Heidegger’s the They, Watsuji’s social realm is not an alienating force that divorces us from our authenticity but the ground out which our authenticity emerges. Criticism can therefore be understood as the judgment of the social realm without it thereby either becoming divorced from the judgment of subjects or simply reduced to an aggregation of the private judgments of so many individuals. The social realm is made of many interlinked realms of publicity and privacy.

Publicity and private existence are mutually entailing terms. Publicity is lack of privacy. It is a mode where everything is shared together. Privacy on the other hand is lack of publicity or a mode which attempts to share nothing. According to Watsuji,

> publicity (_kōkyōsei_ [公共性][ja]) is something that is not hidden from the social realm (*seken* [世間][ja]). That is, it is possible for all persons to take part in it. If persons take part in an existence and are able to **divide and share it together** (*[mit-teilen][de]*), then that existence is public. (WTZ 10:158)

Here Watsuji explains publicity in terms of the German word *[mit-teilen][de]* or “communication.” Another way to put it is that publicity is “the character of the social realm (*seken* [世間][ja]) as such a ‘place (*basho* [場所][ja]) where things are apparent’ “ (WTZ 10:153). Publicity comes about as shared knowledge through our physical communication with one another and not through a kind of extra-sensory “social consciousness” that connects mind to mind directly (WTZ 10:160--2).

Privacy, on the other hand, is the deprivation of social existence:

> the individual moment in human existence becomes apparent as “private existence” (*shi-teki sonzai* [私的存在][ja]). It is an existence which does not become apparent in the place where things become apparent; that is, it is a deprived form (_ketsujo-tai_ [欠如態][ja]) of publicity. It follows that private existence is also **something essentially public**, but this only goes so far as it possesses the mode of _privatus_. (WTZ 10:153)

The logic of Watsuji’s double negation ensures that privacy always contains within itself the seeds of possible communication with others:

> Even things like the secrets hidden away in the depths of one’s heart are private just insofar as one does not desire or allow others to take part in them, and not because it would be absolutely impossible for another to take part in them. (WTZ 10:333)†

† The reader is invited to compare Wittgenstein’s famous “no private languages” argument (*Philosophical Investigations* I §256 and onwards, pp. 78ff).

Privacy comes about because we resist publicity. We hide certain truths away; we exclude others from our groups and associations; we are selective in our loves. This does not mean that privacy is an ill to be combatted as a totalitarian might claim. A family, for example, has certain people who are members of its society and others who are excluded. This gives the family a characteristic of privacy with respect to outsiders but a characteristic of publicity with respect to its members. Hence publicity and privacy are contrastive terms (like *yin* and *yang*), rather than an exclusive binary of absolutes:

> as a deprived form of publicity, private existence is just **a mode of communal existence**. Communal existence realizes itself **through private existing**. (WTZ 10:334)

The communal structures of society depend crucial on the setting of boundaries and the building up of walls, but the tendency of these walls is to slowly crumble due to erosion by the waves of publicity. Hence, Watsuji concludes, “history moves forward, not by hidden true aspects (*shinsō* [真相][ja]), but by publicity” (WTZ10:159). That is, the advance into creative novelty sought in aesthetics and elsewhere depends crucially on the making public of values. Imperfect publicity may conceal the world of a genius today, but if the genius is truly efficacious, it will overcome this concealment tomorrow:

> The publicity that concealed Socrates’ greatness was also exactly the place where his greatness was made apparent. Seen this way, though publicity conceals the true aspects of events, it also makes them apparent. (WTZ 10:159)

The greatness of a genius like Socrates is hidden from the social realm today, but when the truth comes out, the social realm is the space where it presents itself.

One criticism that has been raised of Watsuji’s system is that these publics are structured in a rigid hierarchy from the couple up to the state. The downside of such a rigid hierarchy is that, especially in his war era writings, he may make it seem that the state is synonymous with the totality out of which individuals and collectives emerge, and that the individual must in all cases return to a national totality. Even from his own perspective, it must be emphasized that any concretely realized collective is as empty as the individual, hence it would be wrong for the nation to be given an absolute priority. At best, the nation is able to *symbolize* the absolute in which privacy or exclusion, but it can never itself *be* such an absolute and treating it as a such is the root of many of excesses and errors. That Watsuji himself seems to do so in some of his writings should be seen as a warning to us of the terrible importance of describing the structure of human existence correctly.

###Idols and artifacts
Watsuji’s critics often contend that his system subordinates religion in the service of the state as the public which symbolizes the absolute. These criticism are not without merit but must placed within the broader context of Watsuji’s life and career. In his earliest years, he followed the English Romantics, Bernard Shaw, and even Nietzsche in rejecting religion as an outmoded influence on society, but as time went on he began to reconsider its importance. By the time of his _Revival of the Idols_ (1918), Watsuji had begun to understand religion as an important determinant in the evolution of culture. Where for Nietzsche “idols” represent congealments of life that ought to be destroyed, Watsuji saw also their positive role in the progression of life. In “The Psychology of Idol Worship,”† Watsuji explores the mindset of those Japanese who first accepted the foreign importation of Buddhism to Japan. In it, Watsuji writes,

† “The Psychology of Idol Worship” is _Gūzō Sūhai no Shinri_ [偶像崇拝の心理][ja] (WTZ 17:276--84).

> What especially catches the eye is that they demanded artistic joy (*geijutsu-teki na kanki* [芸術的な歓喜][ja]) from religion. Going further than that, they tied their faith to this sensuous joy. The former is proved by the great art that was born of the Nara period. The latter is unquestionably proven by several prominent social phenomena which manifest how much power the priests of that era held over the human body. These characteristics may have varied in form to some degree but are surely apparent in every religion that has since been born in Japan. […] This close melding of art and religion is able to provide an extremely justified ground for idol worship. (WTZ 17:277)

In other words, the ancient Japanese came to accept Buddhism as a religion first because of their love of the aesthetic, artistic joy it provided, which they expressed through the religious experience of idol worship. In that context, “Art appreciation and religious conversion were one” (WTZ 17:283). As a result, “Just as art appreciation springs in origin out of the inner life of its makers, so idol veneration also springs from the inner life of idol makers” (WTZ 17:283). Watsuji describes the strong aesthetic experience of distancing and dissolution that the early Japanese Buddhist adherents would have had listening to chanting of the monks:

> Those who were intoxicated (_tōsui_ [陶酔][ja]) on music would sometimes open their enchanted eyes and gaze on the heavenly idols. They had already lost consciousness of themselves. They had already integrated the idols into their hearts, and in an infinity of gratitude and blessings they experienced an intense shining and a nimbleness of the whole heart.---Actually, their agitated hearts were extremely sensitive toward the statues and music. The strength and chiaroscuro of that inner life was no different in its extreme intensity of feeling, though it could not be called well defined. When all of their artistic results and religious influences were concentrated on just one point, that is, the veneration of idols, especially as in the aforementioned circumstances, the depth and strength of that ecstasy (_uchōten_ [有頂天][ja]) seems to be almost beyond our imaginations. In this way, our ancestors had tasted one kind of aesthetico-religious great joy (_bi-teki shūkyō-teki na dai-kanki_ [美的宗教的な大歓喜][ja]) in idol worship. (WTZ 17:282)

While a strong influence from Nietzsche is apparent in this passage, we also see the beginnings of unique understanding of the relationship between private religious and aesthetic sentiments and public social conditions. Watsuji shows that the rigid structure and rules of Buddhism, anathema to the Dionysian Nietzsche, have provided the space in which the Japanese devotees can experience an aesthetic rapture together. The rapture of the monks was made possible first by their resolute detachment from the world, which became a precondition for their losing themselves to the world. Though Buddhism took root on the strength of its connection between aesthetic experience and religious experience, nevertheless, it brought a political and social meaning that was to transform Japan:

> The temple of that time was a treasure hall of culture as seen from perhaps any perspective. They were not merely places for the monasticism and discipline of an ascetic lifestyle. Rather, its chief content was the whole of scholarship, artistry, self-cultivation, and so on. It was one place that contained all kinds of spiritual nourishment, as if a university, a theater, an art school, a museum, a music school, a concert hall, a library, and a monastery had all been rolled into one. There the priests heard the sutras containing the Buddha’s lectures on philosophical principles as symbolical poetry. As they became familiar with those legendary, highly symbolic expressions, they connected those lectures with the statues and images of the Buddha that concretized them. (WTZ 17:282)

Here we see that the private aesthetic and religious feelings that swept over the primitive Japanese ended up causing a wholesale reordering of the public. The Buddhist idols had a kind of genius to them that brought with them the power to restructure the social realm of the primitive Japanese.

Unlike Nietzsche’s theory of *[ressentiment][fr]*, as Watsuji portrays it, this restructuring is not the cause of the loss of a more authentic nobility but a deepening of the self-understanding of the Japanese people. Watsuji finds in Buddhism an appreciation for the importance of experiencing the flow of life unimpeded by conceptual congealing similar to Nietzsche’s, and this leads Watsuji to see the positive value of idols, both literal and conceptual. Where Nietzsche casually sneers at the inauthenticity of Buddhism’s life negating tendencies (it is guilty of “denying the will” and “longing for nothingness”[^]), Watsuji began to appreciate life affirming aspect of self-negation in the face of an awesome aesthetic other. Nietzsche was only aware of a caricatured portrait of South Asian non-Mahāyāna Buddhism, but Watsuji was thoroughly acquainted with both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna Buddhism, which gave him a better perspective on the ways in which Buddhism could be life affirming and embrace aesthetic experience. While both Watsuji and Nietzsche emphasize the importance of intoxication to the opening of the self to the Dionysian joy of aesthetic/religious ecstasy, Watsuji also begins to sympathize with the veneration of the idols as well, which is an act that would strike Nietzsche as servile and a betrayal of the will to power. As David B. Gordon argues in _Self-Overcoming_, the common thread connecting Watsuji’s work before and after his _Study of Nietzsche_ (1913) is a recognition of the overcoming of self-egoism as the means of expressing the authenticity of the true self (vi, 13, et al.).

[^]: See Friedrich Nietzsche, _The Birth of Tragedy_, §7, p. 40 and §21, p. 98.

In his preface to _Revival of the Idols_ (WTZ 17:9--17), Watsuji expands the themes of the essays in the collection by illustrating his point with the story of the Apostle Paul. According to Watsuji, Paul was disgusted by the Dionysian excesses of the ancient Athenians, and managed to so impress them with his disdain for idolatry that a period of iconoclasm followed for the better part of two millennia. Watsuji allows that this was for the best historically, and yet we cannot wholly rid ourselves of the idols:

> There is no need at this time to repeat that iconoclasm, or the destruction of idols, is indispensable to the progress of life activity. The flow of life is maintained by this path (*michi* [道][ja]) alone. Idols, which we unceasingly construct in our subconsciouses, must be destroyed by careful and unceasing effort.
>
> And yet, it is not that these idols are created without meaning. They ought to give the flow of life strength in unity and guide the growth of life toward a healthy abundance and beauty. This is the indispensable duty that they have for our life activity. Stuck without them between the confusion of consciousness and the division of desires, a person will end up stunted. It is possible that some will even go so far as treating “nihility” (*kyomu* [虚無][ja]) as an idol in order to be able to lead a life of positivity. (WTZ 17:9)

In other words, the idols cast out by Paul, Nietzsche, and Bacon must not be dismissed out of hand.

What finally brought an end to the era of iconoclasm in the West was a literal return of the idols of the past: ancient Greek and Roman statues were restored to positions of honor within society as part of a revival of classical values. However, the new positions of those statues was by no means identical to what it had been before the period of iconoclasm:

> Nevertheless, idols that have been revived are no longer gods deserving of veneration. No one thought to offer before them a beast in sacrifice. No one thought to entrust his own fate into the hands of these idols. What caused the people tremble was not their being heretical gods but their beauty. Paul’s expulsion of idols is something that should have been accepted as a matter of course only to the degree that the idols were taken to be gods for veneration. However, as works of art which are venerated for their beauty, the idols were offered unfair treatment by Paul. Now that unfair treatment is being recompensed, and the idols are seen by the people as possessing a dignity even as mere works of art. (WTZ 17:12)

In other words, statues like the Venus de Milo continue to possess a kind of awe inspiring power, but we no longer feel that power to be a religious one, but primarily an artistic one. The meaning of its genius has been transmuted. It still contains a world within itself, but this world is now a secular one. Nevertheless, the genius of the work is so great, that even without its religious trappings, we feel compelled to supplicate before its beauty. This shows the change brought about in the status of religion and the change in the status of art. New iconoclasts in the form of anti-clerical and even atheistic movements had taken root in the West, but their iconoclasm could not be total. So soon as they suppressed God, they found that they had to put “Art” on a pedestal to replace him. Watsuji writes,

> The Christian “God” is also a kind of idol. Paul expelled idols made by “the hands of men.” The modern iconoclasts expelled gods made by “the heads of men.” However, just as Paul could not completely purge the idols, the modern iconoclasts were also unable to completely purge God. Even after the much-discussed pronouncement that “God is dead,” a god-seeking heart stealthily takes root in the breast of the people. (WTZ 17:13)
>
> Though we have lost the name of God, nevertheless we cannot refrain from searching for a new name to give Him. Should we call Him “the Will”? Ought we to speak of Him as “the Absolute”? Or might we call Him “the Electron” as well? Perhaps these names ought to be cast out by a new Paul as demonic gods. We have built an altar to “the Unknown God” and await the appearance of a Paul that can clearly preach about God to us. And so we wait in anticipation of the destruction of all of the idols created by the spirit of modernity. (WTZ 17:14--5)

For his part, Watsuji sees both iconoclasm and idol worship as necessary moments in a process of historical unfolding. Neither can exist without the other, because they both bring us closer to discovering the hidden depths of the ordinary. The “god” that we seek is the unknown and unknowable, hence any attempt we make to absolutize the public over the private or vice versa must fail. Our private vision of the good must spill into public life without thereby choking out the possibility of new private visions taking root. The idol worship of sclerotic public values must be smashed by a private zeal for iconoclasm, but so soon as the values of iconoclasts become sclerotic, it is time for a private worship of idols to drive out the iconoclasts who now dominate the public.

The central fact that drives this endless cycle of idol worship and iconoclasm is that there is a mysterious profundity behind everyday life. It is overlooked by the ordinary self, but  we can recover it when we use aesthetic awareness to alert us to the ecstatic interiority of things:

> I preach the path of righteousness. I suppose some will call this banal. I, however, am talking about the joy of discovering new life in the banal. I am trying to tell you about the sweetness of the nectar secreted away inside the shell of the banal. As for the banal---fixed ideas that are taken to have no life---we needs must first shake the dulled senses out of their sleep by waking (_satoru_ [悟る][ja]) the shell itself and then wield an iron hammer to break it apart. The eyes of new senses will for the first time be awakened to the revival of the idols. 
>
> I do not, however, merely aim to “resurrect the old.” When the old is raised up again, the old shell is cast off and a new life shines forth. The fetters of time no longer apply in this new life. It is eternally young, eternally new. My aim is in this way to extoll the eternally present life. I feel a presentiment of a great path that converges in the heart of all idols. And I feel that all human efforts, past and future, will at the last be gathered in the direction of this path. (WTZ 17:16--7)

In this passage, Watsuji waxes purple about the possibility of a more ecstatic existence. Thus we see that for the early Watsuji, religion is not just a means of ethnic self-expression whereby the state comes to enlist higher ideals for its legitimation. At its best, religion is a means to aesthetic appreciation of the eternal in every moment. The difficulty is that over time religions inevitably evolve into mere “idol worship” and must be smashed by iconoclasm so that the innate impulse to religiosity can find new and better ways of expressing itself without being stifled by frozen conceptions of how things ought to be. While this understanding of religion does not make up for the shortcomings of Watsuji’s later “idolization” of the state, it helps put into perspective how such idolization came about, in that he came to identify the state with that power which drives the cycle of idolization and iconoclasm forward. Properly understood, however, we should see the power of genius that deepens the development of history as a creative novelty like a pedestal to the unknown God---the anticipation of a presence ever deferred.

###The genius of Murasaki Shikibu
####*The Tale of Genji*
According to Royall Tyler, one of the many translators of *The Tale of Genji* (*Genji Monogatari* [源氏物語][ja], c. 1010), the following praise by Montaigne of Homer applies to Murasaki Shikibu ([紫式部][ja], 973?--1014? or 1025?), authoress of the *Genji*, in a near perfect parallel:

> It is against nature that he made the most excellent creation that could ever be; for things are normally born imperfect; they then grow and gather strength as they do so. He took poetry and several other sciences in their infancy and brought them to perfect, accomplished maturity. Because of this one may call him the first and last of poets, in accordance with that fine tribute left to us by antiquity: that, having had no predecessor to imitate, he had no successor capable of imitating him. (“Translating The Tale of Genji”)

As Tyler puts it in a lecture about his experiences as a translator,

> *The Tale of Genji* is not the first extended work of prose fiction in Japanese, to say nothing of Latin or Greek, but is surely the earliest such work from anywhere in the world that lives on even today as a widely revered masterpiece. No predecessor in Japanese literature foreshadows its greatness, and nor did any successor equal it thereafter. Since the roughly the first decade of the eleventh century, when the lady Murasaki Shikibu wrote it, it has been the foremost classic of Japan. (“Translating”)

If the phrase “work of genius” applies to anything, it certainly applies to *The Tale of Genji*. *Genji* was undeniably something new. It achieved a scope and scale unprecedented in Japanese literature and transformed the context of its creation. At the same time, however, it is not entirely accurate to see the work as without predecessor. Before *Genji* the genre of *monogatari* ([物語][ja], “tales”) proliferated but was not treated with seriousness. *Monogatari* were written in the classical Japanese vernacular, but literary Chinese was considered much more prestigious at that time. Because only men were encouraged to learn Chinese, many of the best works of classical Japanese were written by and for women---and therefore suffered from a deficit of esteem in the eyes of society. *Genji* showed that it was possible for an author to write a work in Japanese that could rival the best works of Chinese in its ambitions.

*The Tale of Genji* is a work of enormous scope. A full translation into English can easily take over one thousand printed pages. It contains over 430 characters (Morris, 265), but focuses primarily on the life of its eponymous hero, Hikaru Genji [光源氏][ja], and his wives and children. Genji is the son of the Emperor, but because his mother is a low ranking concubines and Genji has no influential male relatives to support him in court, the Emperor believes Genji’s life will go more smoothly if he is deemed a commoner. Genji is stripped of his imperial rank and given the surname Minamoto 源 (“Genji” 源氏 means “one named Minamoto”). From this inauspicious beginning, Genji embarks on a series of love affairs and other adventures in which his star slowly rises. With the passage of time, his charm and good looks eventually cause him to be raised to the rank of honorary retired emperor. The final twelve chapters of the work follow the career of Kaoru (who is falsely believed to be Genji’s son) and Niou (Genji’s grandson) as they reenact some of Genji’s earlier adventures with less success than their illustrious forebear. The work is set about one hundred years before the time of its composition, and despite the enormity of its cast of characters, the author is unerringly consistent in her portrayal of the age, rank, and relationships of the figures appearing (Morris, 266).

In spite of this vast scope, *Genji* manages through its repetition of themes and structures to provide a unity to the work without having to follow the traditional format of conflict, climax, and resolution commonly found in Western novels. According to Ivan Morris in _The World of the Shining Prince_, the central theme of the *Genji* is

> the nebulous, unreal quality of the world about us, and the idea that our life is here is a mere “bridge of dreams” (the title of her final book), over which we cross from one state of existence to another. (271)

While it is true that “the books tend to be more independent than the chapters of most modern novels” (266), the themes of the whole “combine to give it an artistic unity” (267), which makes the work a true “novel” and not just “a haphazardly sequence of loosely connected episodes” (266).† The work makes careful use of foreshadowing and repetition in order to produce a psychological depth few works can rival. Morris writes that Murasaki

† Note, however, that opinions differ. Watsuji felt that the unity of *Genji* was not as unified as it could be and found the work somewhat disjointed (WTZ 4:141--3).

> had keenly observed how different kinds of men and women spoke and behaved, and she tried to enter into their feelings and to know why they acted as they did. She was sensitive to the natural surroundings in which these people lived and to the subtle effects these surroundings had on them. (256)

The genius of the author shows itself in her ability to synthesize these private observations into a new world for public appreciation. A work of genius is one that creates a world that brings privately felt values out for public examination, and *Genji* masterfully allows us to enter into the internal lives of its characters by making unprecedented use of the Japanese language as a tool for penetrating into the perspective of others. Morris notes that classical Japanese, “was endowed with an extremely rich grammatical apparatus but a relatively limited choice of words” (281). Earlier writers had been restricted by these linguistic limitations, but Tyler gives one example of how Murasaki employs the unique grammatical features of classical Japanese to her advantage:

> A feature of Japanese grammar, especially in this earlier period of the language, is that it offers only direct, not indirect speech. It is not possible to say, “He said he would go.” One can only say, “He said, ‘I will go’.” A passage reporting the gist of what someone said therefore looks as though it is repeating the speaker’s precise words. A reader familiar with indirect speech, as the tale’s original audience was not, easily gathers most of the time that the words reported are unlikely to be those originally spoken, or certainly not all of them; but the exclusive use of direct speech certainly gives the narrative freshness and immediacy. Imagine, then, the effect of reporting a character’s silent thoughts in exactly the same way, as unvoiced speech.
>
> Murasaki Shikibu seems to have been the first Japanese writer to exploit interior monologue fully as a narrative technique. When it appears, one suddenly finds oneself listening directly to a character’s thoughts […]. The text shifts from third-person narration to first person interior monologue and back again. (“Translating”)

The overall impression of the text a kind of cloudy feeling that is impossible to convey in translation. The deliberate vagueness of the text can be compared to the sense of _yūgen_ ([幽玄][ja], "mysterious profundity") present in Noh theater discussed in chapter three. One pivots from one perspective to another and inhabits first this and then that character’s point of view. Names and titles are used only sparingly if at all, and typically it is only the level of politeness of the speech employed that allows one to know who is speaking to whom. As Tyler notes,

> The characters seldom call a spade a spade, and moreover their notion of “spade” is very broad. Although the issue of marriage is prominent in the tale, the narrative has no stable word or locution for “marriage” or even for “husband.” ("Translating")

This vagueness is used very deliberately to give the reader an internal sense of the concerns of life for those aristocrats in this very narrow social world. Unlike literary Chinese, in which words are strictly regimented into characters that take on life in relation to one another, in classical Japanese, one word blends into the next in a profusion of auxiliaries, stems, and particles such that it is difficult to say where one ends and the next begins. Each part is interpenetrated by the whole, just as each perspective yields to the next. The genius of the work shown by the way its vocabulary and grammar are made to reinforce its overarching themes.

Where Murasaki’s facility with language particularly shows itself is in the hundreds poems included in the work. Tyler explains that,

> Good manners required every member of the nobility to compose such poems at suitable junctures, and every young lord or lady was brought up so as to be able to do so, although naturally not every effort was a great success. There are 795 poems in *The Tale of Genji*. It is difficult to overstate their importance, readers over the centuries having often valued them above the prose. In fact, for hundreds of years the tale was seen by many as above all a manual of poetic composition. (“Translating”)

Murasaki shows her genius in her ability to match the quality of the poems to their fictional authors. It is impossible for an author to write convincingly about a poet better than himself or herself, but Murasaki is able to match noble poems to the noble characters and coarse poems to the coarse characters with perfect ease. In doing so, she shed light not only on the fictional world of her creation but also takes a world that existed in Japanese history a thousand years ago and is utter distant from our modern lives and makes it seem to unfold before our eyes as something living and breathing even now.

Take for instance, this unusually frank exchange between Genji and Hanachirusato, a woman with whom Genji has had several affairs and who eventually comes to live with him. In chapter 25, *Hotaru* (“Firefly”), she tells him the following poem:

> [その駒もすさめぬ草と名に立てる汀の菖蒲今日や引きつる][ja]<br />
> *Sono koma mo / susamenu kusa to / na ni tateru / mizawa no ayame / kyō ya hikikitsuru*<br />
> <br />
> Have you chosen today to pluck after all at the water’s edge<br />
> the sweet flag that everyone knows full well a steed disdains?†

† Translation here and below is from the Tyler version of the *Genji*, p. 460.

To which he replies,

> [鳰鳥に影をならぶる若駒はいつか菖蒲に引き別るべき][ja]<br />
> *Nio-dori ni / kage wo naraburu / waka-koma wa / itsuka ayame ni / hikiwakaru beki*<br />
> <br />
> When would the young steed who aspires to keep company with the faithful grebe <br />
> ever let himself be drawn to abandon the sweet flag? (460)

About the pair of poems, the narrator comments, “They certainly were blunt enough with each other” (460). This remark may seem puzzling to modern readers---what is blunt about grasses, horses, and birds?---but the explanatory notes in Tyler’s translation make its meaning clear. Hanachirusato is referring to herself as “sweet flag” and to Genji as a “steed.” An earlier poem, *Konkinshū* [古今集][ja] 892, contained a blatantly erotic subtext, “Old is the grass beneath the trees at Ōraki; no steed grazes there, no one comes to mow it” (460 n.16), and Hanachirusato is referring to it in order to express her feelings of neglect as Genji goes off in pursuit of other, often younger women though today he has chosen to return to her. In his response, Genji picks up her metaphor but mentions the grebe because the bird is know for pairing for life (460 n.17). The meaning of his response is that he will be faithful to support Hanachirusato even though she has aged. The genius of Murasaki is that she can make this otherwise impenetrable exchange something inviting to contemporary readers, such that we can look at this exchange through the eyes of Hanachirusato and Genji in turn and see from the perspective of their world just how “blunt” it truly is.

####The world of Murasaki Shikibu
We do not know what name the woman now known to history as “Murasaki Shikibu” [紫式部][ja] used in life, nor can we be sure of her year of birth, her year of death, or indeed even if she was the sole author of *The Tale of Genji* as we have it today. We do know that her father, Fujiwara no Tametoki [藤原為時][ja], served for a time in the Ministry of Ceremony (*Shikibu-shō* [式部省][ja]), hence the use of "Shikibu" as part of her name. "Murasaki," which means purple, is commonly thought to refer to the heroine of *The Tale of Genji*, one of Genji's primary wives, but it could perhaps also refer to the color of her family flower, the wisteria (*fuji* [藤][ja]), or to a poem in the *Kokinshū* [古今集][ja] poetry collection (Morris, 252 n.2). She was probably born between 973 and 977 (Bowring, 9 and Morris, 254) and may have died as early as 1014 or as late as 1031 (Bowring, 15, Morris, 255 and Tyler, "Introduction," xvii). 

Although various theories of alternate authorship for *The Tale of Genji* have been proposed (particularly regarding the later chapters of the work, which take place after the death of Genji), there is no strong evidence to linking anyone other than Murasaki to the text (Tyler, "Introduction," xviii and Morris, 259). There is, however, internal evidence which suggests that the work was written out of order and otherwise edited (Tyler, "Introduction," xvii and WTZ 4:130--43). The oldest manuscripts of *The Tale of Genji* are from some centuries after its composition; nevertheless, the differences between the various manuscript lineages appear to be relatively minor (Tyler, "Introduction," xviii--xix).

Most of what we know for certain about Murasaki's life comes from her diary, started in 1008 and kept for around two years during the period when she would have been writing *The Tale of Genji*. Unfortunately, as Morris notes it "does not help us to fix any accurate chronology; for the Heian diary was an impressionistic literary form rather than a systematic record of events" (255). Indeed, her diary does not even mention the daughter she was raising as a widow (Morris, 254). Nevertheless, the diary does give us some insight into her world and provides the best evidence we have of Murasaki's sole or at least primary authorship of the *Genji*, since it refers to her involvement with the tale. Another frequently used source of first hand information about the life of Murasaki is her poetic memoirs, but as Robert Bowring warns in the introduction to his translation, these are "highly artificial" and "hardly a reliable guide to objective truth" (3).

The impression of Murasaki given by historical accounts is of someone studious and reserved but with a keen insight into the character of the world around her. Bowring calls her "somewhat retiring and pensive" with a "pervasive melancholy" balancing out any *[joie de vivre][fr]* (12).† Entry 71 in her diary paints a self-portrait of a woman somewhat embarrassed by her intelligence trying unsuccessfully to hide her light under a bushel (Bowring, 138--9). As a child Murasaki was more adept at memorizing Chinese characters than her brother, leading their father to lament, "If only you were a boy, how happy I should be!" (Morris, 253). At one point to her dismay, she was even given the nickname "the lady of the Chronicles" for the understanding of *The Chronicles of Japan* (_Nihonshoki_ [日本書紀][ja], 720) demonstrated by *The Tale of Genji* (Morris, 257). When Murasaki is caught secretly teaching Empress Shôshi ([彰子][ja], also called "Akiko") how to read the poems of Bai Juyi ([白居易][zh], 772--846), she remarks on the scandal, "Ah what a prattling, tiresome world it is!" (Bowring, 139). Empress Shôshi is also thought to be the patron who allowed for the composition of the *Genji* after she grew bored of hearing the same old tales night after night. Unlike her peer and literary rival, Sei Shōnagon ([清少納言][ja], c. 966--1017), Murasaki seems never to have had the gift of ready wit but instead had a slower but deeper understanding (Morris, 256).† She married a bit late for her time to a man about the age of her father (Morris calls it "a *[mariage de convenance][fr]*," 254) only to have her husband pass away a few years later. Some speculate this may have influenced the feeling of impermanence (*mujôkan* [無常感][ja]) in the *Tale of Genji*, but Morris finds it unlikely (254). It seems more likely that Murasaki drew inspiration from the Buddhist teachings that dominated the outlook of her era.

† As an illustration of Murasaki's outlook on life, take entry 27 in her diary, "As day dawned I looked outside and saw ducks playing about on the lake as if they had not a care in the world: 'Birds on the water; / can I look at them / dispassionately? / I too am floating through / a sad uncertain world.' They too looked as though they were enjoying life but must often suffer, I thought to myself" (Bowring, 75).

† It is interesting to note that two literary geniuses of the Japanese world would be born and live in such close proximity to one another. One thinks also of the clustering of literary talent in the "moveable feast" of expatriate writers in Paris in the 1920s, artistic talent in the Italian Renaissance, musical talent in turn of the nineteenth century Europe, or philosophical talent in ancient Athens. It seems that nothing spurs on a genius so well as peers of a similarly great stature. A young person begins as a critic of the older genius before developing a new genius of one's own. The social milieu of the Heian court was apparently especially conducive to the development of Japanese literature in spite of (or perhaps even because of) its low social status compared to Chinese.

Murasaki lived during the height of the Heian period ([平安時代][ja], 794--1185). Separated as we are by a millennium of technological progress and social changes, *Genji* beguiles us with what Morris calls "an authentic picture of a beautiful and most intriguing world" (289). The Nara period which had preceded it was a period of tumult and transformation due to the adoption of Buddhism and other mainland influences, but by the time of the Heian these foreign influences had become internalized and were being transformed into a thoroughly native form. It was an era of unprecedented decadence for the aristocrats at the imperial court in what is now Kyōto. In many ways, it was a world “which in customs, beliefs, and social organization was more alien than anything that Gulliver discovered on his travels” (Morris, xii). As Tyler explains, the world of the novel is a world in which

> no one is ever alone. A lord or lady lived surrounded by a more or less large staff of women and, just outside, men. The notions of solitude and privacy did not exist. ("Introduction," xix)

This is the stage upon which Genji conducted his many romances. The number and frequency of these affairs has been a scandal to many later readers, but we must not think of his world as one "blithe permissiveness" when we consider the many means that were employed "to defeat erotic spontaneity" by separating men and women (xix). Etiquette and architecture were entirely arranged to allow only indirect communication while hindering direct visual contact. In this world, when a man in love with a woman he has never seen "takes it upon himself to brush her curtain aside and go straight to her, he will by that gesture alone have claimed something like the final intimacy" (xix). It within this atmosphere of simultaneous absolute publicity and privacy that the term *yo no naka* [世の中][ja] ("being in the world," cf. *seken* [世間], "the social realm") came to also take on the narrower meaning of "the relationship between a particular man and woman" (xx) because of the paradoxical centrality of this relationship to the conduct of existence.

In spite of the seemingly alien nature of the customs of Heian court life, Morris finds that

> one of the remarkable things about this novel of a millennium ago is how readily we can enter into the thoughts and feelings of its characters and respond to the total vision of life that its author communicated. The more we know about its times---social organizations, religious ideas, marriage customs, literary conventions, and so forth---the greater our understanding will be. Yet, even with the most elementary knowledge of the Heian background, the sensitive reader can grasp the psychology of a character like Kaoru, for example, and appreciate the close connection between beauty and sorrow that is the underlying theme of the novel. (278)

This surely is the greatest testament to the genius of *The Tale of Genji* and its author: that it draws us into its world not by minimizing the differences between its world and our own but by inviting us to give up our attachment to our ordinary self and to look deeply into a beautiful world now gone.

####*Genji* and the critical tradition
The continued vitality of *Genji* is shown in part by the number of adaptations that continue to be made of the work. It has been made into at least three different films (1951, 1966, 1987), a television series (2009), and even an opera (1999). Chief among these adaptations are the many translations. As Royall Tyler notes, the first complete translation of *Genji* was [Yosano][sc] Akiko’s 1913 translation of the work into modern Japanese---a task only slightly less demanding than a translation into a wholly foreign language (“Translating”). Complete, direct translations now exist in at least a half-dozen languages with more being made all the time ("Translating"). <!-- Waley's second nationalism? -->

One of the earliest bits of "critical reception" to *The Tale of Genji* that we have outside of Murasaki's own diary is by the thirteen year old author of the Sarashina Diary ([更級日記][ja], c. 1022):

> I read *Waka Murasaki* and a few of the other early books in *The Tale of Genji*, and I longed to see the later parts… I was feeling most dejected about it when one day I called on an aunt of mine… And so it was that she presented me with fifty-odd volumes of *The Tale of Genji* in a special case… Oh, how happy I was when I came home with all these books in a bag! (Morris, 263)

Apart from the reaction of readers like this, one of the most important of critics of *The Tale of Genji* has been Motoori Norinaga ([本居宣長][ja], 1730--1801). Norinaga was a pioneer in the field of National Studies (*kokugaku*, [国学][ja]), and his many writings on *The Tale of Genji* work diligently to downplay any foreign or Buddhist influences within the text.

###Conclusion
####Defense of the possibility of Watsujian aesthetics
In “Art and Ethics in Watsuji Tetsurō’s Philosophy,” Hiroshi Nara objects that Watsuji’s anthropology makes artistic genius impossible because

> Art is not an expression of the artist as an individual but of the artist as defined in his affiliation to the larger social and political entity. There would be no art-for-art’s-sake in which art functions as an instrument of personal emancipation. That is, the artist would be in service of the group and, eventually, to the state. (112)

Furthermore, Watsuji’s aesthetics leaves art with

> no power to give birth to a new form of art which can challenge the status quo of society, including art. This is because moral laws, which artists must abide by, come from the absolute negation of the autonomous self. And only in this way, that is, by means of emptying the self into the totality of the nation, a person can be one with the nation. For an artist, there is no art that is subversive or produced to fulfill personal emancipation in Watsuji’s framework. (113)

Nara is correct to claim that for Watsuji the artist emerges out of the social fabric of morality, but he is wrong to claim that employing Watsujian anthropology thereby suppresses all possibility of genius or historical change. It is precisely as a moralist that Watsuji feels qualified to speak to the ability of art and genius to subvert present art forms and advance history. For Watsuji, local ethics follow the local ethos---the local way of life---according to the patterns described by universal ethics. As the local ethos changes, so too will local ethics. The artist who attempts to fashion an aesthetic experience is naturally limited by the contours of society as it presently exists, since it will be impossible for the artist to facilitate distance and ecstasy in relation to an object if the structure of society does not allow for such the reception of such objects. The paintings of Pollock could never have gained an audience in the salons of the 1850’s, for example, which means they would not have provoked an aesthetic experience for anyone at that time. When society has changed or is changing, however, a great artist is to become aware of the possibilities this creates and express those possibilities in art in such a way that a new category of aesthetic experience opens up. Genius gives the rule to art, but only in those historical and climatic milieux in which the rule can be successfully taken up. The genius of Japanese tea ceremony or flower arranging, for example, were never taken up in the West, but Japanese _ukiyo-e_ woodblock prints directly inspired van Gogh, and through him influenced all Western painting following the post-Impressionist period.

This last example allows us to better understand the phenomenon of persistent aesthetic disagreement. It should be readily apparent from what has already been said that differences of history and milieu between different communities may inhibit the emergence of shared canons of taste for the different groups. It is not a coincidence, for example, that we often observe opposition to the way of life presupposed by hip-hop music as coinciding with opposition to the music itself. The music is an expression of a form of living and to oppose the one is naturally entangled with opposition of the other. On the other hand, we must also consider more closely the issue of aesthetic disagreements within a community. It may be the case that one individual with an otherwise ordinary background opposes some well regarded figure in the canon of an aesthetic community. This too we can account for on Watsuji’s theory as a natural expression of the fundamental law of humanity. The individual defines herself as an individual by negation of her society. Without some form of opposition to the view of the public, there could be no defined individuals to speak of. What is more, we find that as an isolated opinion such a view will not rise to the level of a sustained disagreement within the aesthetic community; however, should such a view gain wider prevalence it will do so either by splitting the community into two opposed factions with different canons of taste or by causing the evolution of the community’s tastes to better reflect its current forms of life.

    - Museums are the one place where religion, nationalism, and aesthetics come together. Museums are substitute temples and often get filled with religious artifacts. They glorify their home nations either for plundering other people or for creating stuff itself. Cf. Heidegger’s theory of a work of art as temple based.
