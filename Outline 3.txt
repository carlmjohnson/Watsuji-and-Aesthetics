Is ethics objective or subjective? Kant is subjective, because it depends on the subject’s intention not the consequences. Mill is objective, because it depends on the objective consequences, not the subject’s intentions. But for Kant, your duties are objective matter as is whether you as a subject comport to your duties correctly. And for Mill, what makes a consequence good is just that subject out there are pleased by it. So, Kant is objective and Mill is subjective. Clearly, this is a contradiction. So which is it? Either objectively subjective or subjectively objective…

#**I TOUCH WHAT I SAW**

  

The topic of this paper is, broadly speaking, “taste” or “aesthetics,” but
some clarification of these terms is needed, since this is comparative
dissertation that will examine Japanese, Classical Chinese, and Western
concepts. Aesthetics in particular has a certain ambiguity that is reflected
by the fact that it can be translated into Japanese in at least two distinct
manners. One translation of aesthetics, _bigaku_ 美学, is a Sino-Japanese
compound meaning literally “the study of the beautiful.” (That it is _bi_
which is studied is particularly noteworthy because it means the beautiful
adjectivally rather than a Greek conception of Beauty as a freestanding noun.
This has the effect of relating Japanese _bigaku_ always to the context of the
beautiful rather than an abstracted study of beauty divorced from
contextuality.) Another translation of aesthetics into Japanese is as _kansei_
感性, which might also be rendered into English as “sensibility.” This second
translation is perhaps closer to the root Greek word [αἰσθάνομαι][gr], “I
perceive.” Unlike the neutral “sense” or “perception,” however, the _kan_ part
of _kansei_ strongly implies the feeling of emotion or value, not merely
valueless sense data. For the purposes of this study, the question is how it
is possible for something like _kansei_, our individual value feelings, to be
the basis of _bigaku_, what is felt to be beautiful as such. “Taste” is the
name we give to that ability which converts from the one aesthetic order to
the other: _kansei_ to _bigaku_. By refining our taste, we widen our
sensibilities in order to make sharper judgments of the values inherent in the
world around us. At the same time, we must also resolve the question of
whether taste as an appreciation of the beautiful can be separated from other
forms of value judgment, such as the ethical and the political.

  

> ***OED aesthetic, adj. and n.*** Etymology: mod. < Greek αἰσθητικ-ός , of or
pertaining to αἰσθητά , things perceptible by the senses, things material (as
opposed to νοητά things thinkable or immaterial), also ‘perceptive, sharp in
the senses’; < vb. stem αἰσθε- ‘feel, apprehend by the senses’. Applied in
German by Baumgarten (1750–58, Æsthetica) to ‘criticism of taste’ considered
as a science or philosophy; against which, as a misuse of the word found in
German only, protest was made by Kant (1781, Crit. R.V. 21), who applied the
name, in accordance with the ancient distinction of αἰσθητά and νοητά , to
‘the science which treats of the conditions of sensuous perception,’ a sense
retained in the Kantian philosophy, and found in English c1800. But
Baumgarten's use of æsthetik found popular acceptance, and appeared in English
after 1830, though its adoption was long opposed. (See below.) Recent
extravagances in the adoption of a sentimental archaism as the ideal of beauty
have still further removed æsthetic and its derivatives from their
etymological and purely philosophical meaning. ‘The pronunciations /ɛsˈθɛtɪk/
, /iːsˈθɛtɪk/ , /ɛsˈθiːtɪk/ , /iːsˈθiːtɪk/ , are all in use; the second is at
present most common in London’ ( N.E.D., 1884).
