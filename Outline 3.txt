Outline:

Thoughts:
-	3 needs to follow the reduction construction destruction pattern. 
- Aesthetic experience
	- Bigaku vs. Kangaku
- The subjectivity/objectivity of aesthetic judgment
 - Trust as ground of ordinary truth
 - Truth value of aesthetic judgments vs. Kant
	- Kantian disinterest vs. Detachment during construction
-	Example of driving a car as aspectival perception.

- 	Sonzai and Seken: the content that the subject experiences.

- Bigaku vs. kankaku gaku

Is ethics objective or subjective? Kant is subjective, because it depends on the subject’s intention not the consequences. Mill is objective, because it depends on the objective consequences, not the subject’s intentions. But for Kant, your duties are objective matter as is whether you as a subject comport to your duties correctly. And for Mill, what makes a consequence good is just that subject out there are pleased by it. So, Kant is objective and Mill is subjective. Clearly, this is a contradiction. So which is it? Either objectively subjective or subjectively objective…

-	Taste judgment also follows the law of ningen: I like as an individual vs. we like as an art-world. The aesthetic experience is a moment in this process.

-	Tea ceremony: shows the aesthetic as action, not observation. Flower arranging: show the aesthetic as contextual, not universal (flowers are for the occasion).

-	How different are aisthesis and theoria? Both are a vision of the thing in itself. I guess for Plato the difference is that theoria is powered by anamnensis whereas aisthesis is sensual.

-	In _Kusa Makura_, Sōseki concludes that _compassion_ is the right way to do aisthesis. 

-	Ends vs. Means, Intrinsic value vs. Instrumental value, is the core of what it is to have Kantian disinterest. The disinterested view just "lets it be." Watsuji is similar, but for him being is doing. How you go about letting it be is active, not contemplative. Think about fanfic and fan-wikis and fannon. These things show that "letting it be" means "letting it do."
	
	Re: also emotion in Japanese verse. The scene "contains" the emotion already. Isn't that absurd though? No, because the containing is about an active engagement of subject and object, not a passive reception of the object by the subject. Hence Watsuji's aesthetics are a re-descriptive of Japanese history not accidentally or insidiously but essentially since re-description is what we do when we do aesthetics. 

-	Aesthetic subjectivism is the view that the most important part of a painting qua artwork is the frame. The frame (culturally) prompts you to see the painting as artwork. But actually everything is artwork and the distinction between artwork/non-artwork is specious.

-	Riken no ken as Whiteheadian perspective taking. Defend the view from each against the view from nowhere.

-	Defend exploration of aesthetics on the ground that it, like ethics, is a uniquely human activity, therefore it must come from ningen sonzai. 

-	Look for genus & species of aesthetics as definition. Genus seems like experience (duh), so of course it falls under dialectic, like everything else experienced. What is particular to the aesthetic part of it though?

-	Defend self from the obvious problem that Watsuji hates observers? Or wait for chapter four…

-	For Kant, stars are paradigmatic objects of beauty because not subject to practical concern, but Watsuji is basically obsessed with praxis. どうすんの？

-	Watsuji says that pain can be shared. That means other aesthetic experiences are also sharable. 

-	Does the “mindfulness” of washing the floor fit my scheme?

-	Trust and truth apt-ness

-	Plato was pro-Beauty while being anti-aesthesis and anti-art because he thought the Truth of the Being of a thing is its Real Beauty. I think Watsuji can also be taken to be pro-Being-Authentic, but his essences are dynamic not static

-	When I say, “This ice cream is delicious,” am I telling you about the ice cream or about me?
	Plausibly, it could be either depending on circumstances. Imagine I’m picking out ice cream for my birthday party. In that case, I want ice cream that suits me. On the other hand, suppose I am picking out ice cream for someone else’s birthday party. In that case, I am guessing what the birthday boy and guests will like (Which is a fact about the ice cream somehow? It has the property of BEING LIKABLE??).

-	Is comedy subjective or objective?

-	Love for Aristophanes in the Symposium is love of one’s other half, that is another bit of oneself. 
Watsuji seems to be similar, since he also sees Good as one’s own good due to the interconnection of selves.

-	Western paintings are appreciated by looking at the image and considering what is an image of or how the image looks. Eastern paintings are appreciated by imagining painting it yourself.

-	Are we really disinterested when watching a play? Don’t we really want to know if the hero will win or the lovers be happy? Or am I confusing disinterested with uninterested? 

-	Hershock: You can tell if you’ve found the appropriate because the jazz band keeps on swingin’ in the style of an infinite goal.

-	What is the purpose of criticism? Is it just “understanding” art? To allow for deeper experiences? Or is it to kick art in a new direction? (Cf. Watsuji on “understanding” as the new goal brought by hermeneutics.)
