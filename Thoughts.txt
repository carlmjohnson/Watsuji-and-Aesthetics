Art forms to talk about: Music (rock, hip-hop, religious), architecture (vs. fūdo?), haiku/poetry, theater, fashion, tea, cooking, painting (suiboku vs. youga), literature, archery, budo, museums

Overall questions on Watsuji--how good of a job is he doing of sorting out the following binaries (privileged term first):
- East - West
- Collective - Individual
- Culture - Art
- Climate - History
- State - Religion

Chapter 2: Watsuji

-	Defense of human interconnectedness can be a pri or a post, but etymology is somewhere in between.

-	Hermeneutics is a dynamic interplay of reason (logos), praxis, and theoria. Cf. Watsuji’s threefold method. Double cf. the emphasis on shutai as subject of praxis.

-	Does it make sense to criticize Watsuji as reciprocal in relations and also as too community heavy?

-	There are at least three senses of negation: Hegelian, Buddhist, teenage rebellion

-	Emptiness is creative in East Asian Buddhism. In Platonism, Becoming is creative because it is between Being and Nothing on the Great Chain of Beings.

-	Is emptiness reducible or not?

-	Is emptiness just the transcendent third term? Why not?

-	John Donne’s “no man is an island” is a great quote.

Chapter 3: Aesthetic Experience

-	Watsuji says that pain can be shared. That means other aesthetic experiences are also sharable. 

-	Does the “mindfulness” of washing the floor fit my scheme?

-	Trust and truth apt-ness

-	Plato was pro-Beauty while being anti-aesthesis and anti-art because he thought the Truth of the Being of a thing is its Real Beauty. I think Watsuji can also be taken to be pro-Being-Authentic, but his essences are dynamic not static

-	When I say, “This ice cream is delicious,” am I telling you about the ice cream or about me?
	Plausibly, it could be either depending on circumstances. Imagine I’m picking out ice cream for my birthday party. In that case, I want ice cream that suits me. On the other hand, suppose I am picking out ice cream for someone else’s birthday party. In that case, I am guessing what the birthday boy and guests will like (Which is a fact about the ice cream somehow? It has the property of BEING LIKABLE??).

-	Is comedy subjective or objective?

-	Love for Aristophanes in the Symposium is love of one’s other half, that is another bit of oneself. 
Watsuji seems to be similar, since he also sees Good as one’s own good due to the interconnection of selves.

-	Western paintings are appreciated by looking at the image and considering what is an image of or how the image looks. Eastern paintings are appreciated by imagining painting it yourself.

-	Are we really disinterested when watching a play? Don’t we really want to know if the hero will win or the lovers be happy? Or am I confusing disinterested with uninterested? 

-	Hershock: You can tell if you’ve found the appropriate because the jazz band keeps on swingin’ in the style of an infinite goal.

Chapter 4: Subjectivity

-	McCarthy quotes Kasulis as talking about a gloomy locker room, which strikes me as a good example.

-	Home theater system vs. a movie theater vs. a real theatre.

-	Recall Stan Lee’s greatest invention was the illusion of a community of comic book artists (a “scene”)
	Re: Hip hop music, chiptunes, etc.

-	At 424c of Republic, Plato assumes that a change of music will (signal? cause?) a change of the polis.
	Does Watsuji have similar assumptions? (Yeah, probably.) Is it a cause or an effect?

-	Uniforms vs. fashion as imposed collectivity vs. intrinsic. You can not wear a uniform, but you can’t not have a fashion-style. While wearing a uniform we feel extra bad about betraying our duties. Why? Somaticity, probably.

-	What is the purpose of criticism? Is it just “understanding” art? To allow for deeper experiences? Or is it to kick art in a new direction?

Chapter 5: Climate and History

-	Climate:History::Body:Spirit. In evolution, organisms adapt to and create a climate, changing their bodies as they do so, but as expression of the spirit of progression towards good.

-	Ancient Greeks and Easter Islanders are both dead, but it’s better to have been a Greek

-	Humans are unique in that we live in every climate from Antarctica to the Sahara. Most lifeforms either can’t do that or they just go to the other climate directly without having to specifically adapt culturally.

-	Fūdo vs. Oku no Hosomichi as travel literature.

-	There are at least three meanings of “history”. 

	1. Everything that really happened.
	2. The important things that happened. 
	3. How we recalled or are shaped by the past.

	Climate has similar issues with “subjectivity” and “objectivity.” Both of them are both psychic and regular.

-	Complaining about cold in Hawaii

-	For Watsuji, it’s not that the environment is a pool of resources to satisfy our own desires. Rather, the environment is a subjective space out which our desires emerge. Thus, Watsuji’s environmental ethics won’t be overly instrumental, even if he does seem to be anthropocentric.

	We are interconnected both as agents and as observers. So, Fūdo isn’t just a resource pool for us. We want fish because we have fish. We need to understand our “debts” to history and to climate.

	It's not that Americans loved cars and built suburbs. They built roads and then loved their cars for taking them down those roads.

-	Internal structures get exposed when you take the content from one context and put it into another. For example, in Republic, Socrates asks about justice in the context of a crazy drunk friend. Similarly, world-traveling.

-	Maria Lugones on loving perception?

-	Outsiders can never know 日本の精神, but neither can insiders. Knowledge is made through contrasts (cleavages), which comes from ex-stasis of the self.

Chapter 6: Religion

-	Museums are the one place where religion, nationalism, and aesthetics come together. Museums are substitute temples and often get filled with religious artifacts. They glorify their home nations either for plundering other people or for creating stuff itself. Cf. Heidegger’s theory of a work of art as temple based.

-	The failure of religious congruence is a bit mysterious. Why do we do rituals even if we don’t believe that they’ll work? “Their social value.” But that just begs the question! Why is there social value to be had in useless acts when we call them religion?

-	Nations aim to bury their religious “diversity” (in Peter Hershock’s phrase) under mere religious “variety” by building up a sufficiently strong sense of civic religion that one’s particular religion is no longer relevant. We all say the same pledge of allegiance, take the same Thanksgiving break, etc.

-	In liberalism, what’s private is private forever (religion) and what’s public is public forever (politics). For feminists and other Marxists, the personal is the political. (They’re totalitarians like that.) For Watsuji, 私 and 公 are negatively linked and interchange. We build up a sense of ourselves in 私 and then that cycles into the 公 eventually as a new, different realm of 私 bubbles up in the space newly created.
