* • How is aesthetic agreement possible? Is there such a thing as compulsion in aesthetic judgment? Is aesthetic experience active (agentive) or passive (observed)? (Chapter 4)

* • Why are there regional variations in aesthetics? Is there such a thing as progress in aesthetics? What is genius? Is aesthetics independent or is it subordinate to other concerns? Why are there persistent aesthetic disagreements? (Chapter 5)

* • Is there any link between beauty and (moral) goodness? How does aesthetics relate to religion? (Chapter 6)

-	John Donne’s “no man is an island” is a great quote.

##Preface
- Biography:
	- To understand how Watsuji’s ethics fit into an existential framework, it worth briefly reviewing the philosophical influences that he took in over the course of his life. 

[Watsuji][sc] Tetsurō was born in Himeji?

- Politics (man, everyone calls him fascist…)
	- Why? 1. The left hates any non-left
	- 2. He tried to be in the middle, which doesn't work. You should condemn fascism straight up!
	- 3. He made a lot of unfortunate choices in terms of supporting the war, not standing up for his colleagues.

## Chapter 5: Climate and History
-	空 as 空間性

-	名物 vs. Climate, 個店主義, nation vs. Locality. Lumpers vs. Splitters. 

-	Climate:History::Body:Spirit. In evolution, organisms adapt to and create a climate, changing their bodies as they do so, but as expression of the spirit of progression towards good.

-	Ancient Greeks and Easter Islanders are both dead, but it’s better to have been a Greek

-	Humans are unique in that we live in every climate from Antarctica to the Sahara. Most lifeforms either can’t do that or they just go to the other climate directly without having to specifically adapt culturally.

-	Fūdo vs. Oku no Hosomichi as travel literature.

-	There are at least three meanings of “history”. 

	1. Everything that really happened.
	2. The important things that happened. 
	3. How we recalled or are shaped by the past.

	Climate has similar issues with “subjectivity” and “objectivity.” Both of them are both psychic and regular.

-	Complaining about cold in Hawaii

-	For Watsuji, it’s not that the environment is a pool of resources to satisfy our own desires. Rather, the environment is a subjective space out which our desires emerge. Thus, Watsuji’s environmental ethics won’t be overly instrumental, even if he does seem to be anthropocentric.

	We are interconnected both as agents and as observers. So, Fūdo isn’t just a resource pool for us. We want fish because we have fish. We need to understand our “debts” to history and to climate.

	It's not that Americans loved cars and built suburbs. They built roads and then loved their cars for taking them down those roads.

-	Internal structures get exposed when you take the content from one context and put it into another. For example, in Republic, Socrates asks about justice in the context of a crazy drunk friend. Similarly, world-traveling.

-	Maria Lugones on loving perception?

-	Outsiders can never know 日本の精神, but neither can insiders. Knowledge is made through contrasts (cleavages), which comes from ex-stasis of the self.

-	Takarazuka as a dialectical evolution.

## Chapter 6: Religion

-	Whitehead says that religion is what we do with our aloneness. I think for Watsuji, religion is how we share our aloneness. "Alone together" is a powerful force, and is naturally concomitant with nationalism, clericalism, etc. 

-	Religion vs. nationalism :: individual vs. group? Nationalism is an endemic force in human life that causes us to identify our group as the absolute totality. Religion is the force that causes us to constantly defer and say that the totality is not yet come. In that sense, religion individualizes the communal or communalizes aloneness, whereas nationalism makes the individual subordinate to the community while also making each individual a sovereign unto herself. Religion is a kind of fellow feeling for the other (stranger); nationalism is the absence of a feeling of otherness internally and strong feeling otherness externally. Religion tries to move the cycle along; nationalism freezes the division in its place. 

	As ever, I maintain it is silly to try to create cosmopolitanism by eliminating patriotism or create concern for strangers by eliminating concern for family. The point is to bring outsiders inside, not to eliminate the inside/outside binary. Once the outsiders are inside, if there's no love of insiders, what was the point? (Love your neighbor as yourself…)
	
	Liberalism and totalitarianism are both "bad" in Watsuji's sense because they attempt to freeze the private/public distinction in one place. For totalitarianism, there is no private, which is bad, but for liberalism, the private is one corner of reality with no public meaning (behind the wall of church and state), which is also bad. To be good, the private should grow into the public and shrink out from it as necessary.

-	Museums are the one place where religion, nationalism, and aesthetics come together. Museums are substitute temples and often get filled with religious artifacts. They glorify their home nations either for plundering other people or for creating stuff itself. Cf. Heidegger’s theory of a work of art as temple based.

-	The failure of religious congruence is a bit mysterious. Why do we do rituals even if we don’t believe that they’ll work? “Their social value.” But that just begs the question! Why is there social value to be had in useless acts when we call them religion?

-	Nations aim to bury their religious “diversity” (in Peter Hershock’s phrase) under mere religious “variety” by building up a sufficiently strong sense of civic religion that one’s particular religion is no longer relevant. We all say the same pledge of allegiance, take the same Thanksgiving break, etc.

-	In liberalism, what’s private is private forever (religion) and what’s public is public forever (politics). For feminists and other Marxists, the personal is the political. (They’re totalitarians like that.) For Watsuji, 私 and 公 are negatively linked and interchange. We build up a sense of ourselves in 私 and then that cycles into the 公 eventually as a new, different realm of 私 bubbles up in the space newly created.
