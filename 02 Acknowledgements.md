<div class="frontquote">
<blockquote><p>And the <span class="smallcaps">Lord</span> God said, &ldquo;It is not good that the man should be alone.&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>&mdash; Genesis 2:18</p>

<blockquote><p>No man is an island, entire of itself; every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main. If a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe is the less, as well as if a promontory were, as well as if a manor of thy friend’s or of thine own were: any man’s death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee.</p></blockquote>

<p>&mdash; John Donne, Meditation XVII</p>

<blockquote><p>How selfish soever man may be supposed, there are evidently some principles in his nature, which interest him in the fortune of others, and render their happiness necessary to him, though he derives nothing from it except the pleasure of seeing it.</p></blockquote>

<p>&mdash; Adam Smith, <em>The Theory of Moral Sentiments</em></p>

<blockquote><p>The history of mankind, as a history of the human spirit, may be thought of consisting of two elements: an escape from this world to another; and a return to it. Chronologically speaking, these two movements, the rise and fall, represent the whole of human history; and the two take place microcosmically many times in people and nations. But they may be thought of as taking place simultaneously or rather, beyond time, and then they form an ontological description of human nature.</p></blockquote>

<p>&mdash; R. H. Blyth, <em>Haiku</em></p>
