##Chapter 2. Anthropology and Methodology
###Ethics as first philosophy
####Inquiry as human inquiry
Having raised the question of subjectivity and objectivity in aesthetics, where should I begin my investigation? I will argue that [Watsuji][sc] Tetsurō was right to suggest that our first philosophy must be “the study of ethics as the study of human beings” (_ningen no gaku to shite no rinrigaku_ [人間の学としての倫理学][ja]), and that this must also be the basis of our theory of aesthetics. To understand the relationship between the subject and object of aesthetics, we must first understand who is having an aesthetic experience and why. Kant famously concludes the _Critique of Pure Reason_ with three questions---“What can I know? What ought I to do? What may I hope?”---to which he later adds a fourth---“What is a human being?”[^fn2-1] Though the questions are hopelessly intertwined, Kant comes to conclusion that the fourth relates to the other three. Through a philosophical anthropology, we learn what we as human beings may know, what we ought to do as the sort of beings we are, and what aspirations are rational for us to have. Similarly, our understanding of how aesthetics is possible will be critically shaped by our philosophical anthropology. As I showed in the first chapter, the question of subjectivity and objectivity in aesthetics cannot be addressed without first having a clear philosophical anthropology.

[^fn2-1]: The three questions first appear in the _Critique of Pure Reason_ on B 832--3. The fourth question is added in the _Logic_ (Ak. IX, 25).

In this chapter, I will use Watsuji’s philosophical anthropology to show that our understanding of aesthetics must begin from the proposition that human beings exist not as substantive individuals nor as mere organic parts of a substantive social whole, but in the emptiness between these two poles. The fundamental law of human beings is to dynamically negate these two moments of human existence. Accordingly, our investigation of aesthetics must proceed on the grounds of a hermeneutic inquiry that restores, reconstructs, and deconstructs the moments of unity, division, and combination in our existence. This opens the space in which an aesthetic of persistent relationality can be constructed.

Where Watsuji’s approach differs from many of his Western forebears is the picture of the human being from which he begins. Watsuji suggests we understand humankind not only as “the rational animal” or “the political animal” but also as “the moral animal.” Human beings must be understood both through their communities and through the individuals in those communities. As a result, accounts of human beings as the rational animal or the political animal are ultimately also accounts for human beings as the moral animal. As rational, we give accounts to one another, and the accounts we give are expected to be truthful ones because of our nature as moral and concerned with truth. As political, we live together in community, and what makes this life possible are the human virtues.[^fn2-2] The advantage of an approach that begins with ethics is it can retain the practical, lived dimension of aesthetics. Although [Wang][sc] Yangming’s ([王陽明][zh], 1472--1529) version of Confucianism never achieved the status of orthodoxy, his slogan---_zhixing heyi_ [知行合一][zh], “Unity of knowledge and practice”---is representative of a broad current of East Asian thought, including Watsuji’s.[^fn2-3] Living in the twentieth century, Watsuji culturally inherited this tendency of thought, and in his mature writings, he defends it explicitly and repeatedly. We engage in aesthetic practices together for purposes both communal and individual---that is, we make both collective judgments as an art world while forming personal tastes as individuals. Our knowledge of aesthetics is borne out by our practices as individuals embedded in communities.

[^fn2-2]: See the appendix to *Study of Ethics*,  “Varieties of Virtue” (_Shosō no Toku_ [諸相の徳][ja], WTZ 10:627--59) for an extended discussion by Watsuji of how [ἀρετή][el], *virtus*, _de_ [德][zh], and “virtue” all function as the particular excellences that make a particular community possible. So, for example, the Platonic virtues of justice, moderation, courage, and wisdom were necessary for life in the Greek polis and the contemporary virtues of liberty, equality, and fraternity are necessary for a democratic polity.

[^fn2-3]: Cf. [Nishida][sc] Kitarō, “as in Wang Yangming’s emphasis on the identity of knowledge and action, true knowledge is always accompanied by the performance of the will. To think in a certain way but not to desire in the same way means that one does not yet truly know” (_An Inquiry Into the Good_, 90).

As Watsuji writes in his masterwork _The Study of Ethics_, whatever topic we pursue will be in the end a topic of _human_ inquiry:

> science (_gakumon_ [学問][ja]) and inquiry (_toi_ [問い][ja]) are both the behavior of humans, not isolated observers. Science is a persistent relationship (_aidagara_ [間柄][ja]) of pursuit. The “thing” pursued subsists publicly (_kōkyō-teki ni_ [公共的に][ja]) in the persistent relationships of human beings. That is, inquiry is fundamentally (_kompon-teki_ [根本的][ja]) “human inquiry.” […] A person could try to question a natural object in isolation from human connections alone in one’s study. However, should one do so, how could one escape the state of affairs that this is also in the final reckoning a human inquiry? When one discusses the question with another pursuer, one has already placed the inquiry into the human realm as a communal (_kyōdō_ [共同][ja]) inquiry. (WTZ 10:32)

It should be clear how much more this applies in the case of aesthetics.

In spite of having made this brief argument for philosophical anthropology as first philosophy and human beings as communal, practical, and active, the reader should, I hope, retain a certain degree of skepticism about whether *any* approach to first philosophy can be ultimately satisfying. Perhaps even using the term “first philosophy” to explain the methodology in use here betrays too much of a foundationalist bias. Hence Watsuji’s insistence that our method in “the study of ethics as the study of human beings” be a hermeneutic one is quite appropriate. While our investigation of aesthetics must begin by studying human beings as communal and ethical beings, it is not enough to try set forth initial “unhypothetical” first principles and proceed from there. Rather, we must continually revisit and refine our understanding as our investigation becomes deeper.

####_Rinrigaku_ and “ethics”
In order to posit “the study of ethics as the study of human beings” (_ningen no gaku to shite no rinrigaku_ [人間の学としての倫理学][ja]) as first philosophy propaedeutic to the study of aesthetics, I must first clarify what this means. For Watsuji, the study of ethics is, as its name in Japanese (_rinrigaku_ [倫理学][ja]) suggests, the study (*gaku* [学][ja]) of the patterns (*ri* [理][ja]) of human relations (*rin* [倫][ja]).

As he writes in his _Study of Ethics_,

> The word “ethics” (_rinri_ [倫理][ja]) is made from two parts: _rin_ [倫][ja] and _ri_ [理][ja]. _Rin_ means “fellows” (_nakama_ [なかま][ja]). “Fellows” means both the group as the relational system of specified persons and the individual persons who are prescribed by the group. […] It follows that _rin_ means “fellows” and also a specified form of linkages of conduct (_kōi-teki renkan_ [行為的連関][ja]). As a result, _rin_ comes to mean a “pattern,” “form,” or “order” in human existence. (WTZ 10:12--3)

According to Morohashi’s _Dai Kan-Wa Jiten_, the meaning of the character [倫][zh] as “fellows” and derivatively their order can be seen even in the _Shuowen_ [說文][zh] dictionary of the Han Dynasty, where [倫][zh] is defined the social classes of the human way. _Mencius_ 3A.4 lists what came to be known in Japan as _gorin_ [五倫][ja], the five key relationships: parent to child, ruler to vassal, husband to wife, elder to younger, and friend to friend. These relationships are general patterns we must flesh out with particular content and meaning for our lives. These relationships have normative content---to be a parent means to fulfill certain duties in order to be a *good* parent---but at the same time, they do not present a universal system of obligations and duties---each child is different, so each parent must respond to each child differently.

The point of this etymological investigation for Watsuji is that ethics was originally a question of social relationships, and as such it should be explored today not only from a theoretical or _a priori_ perspective, but from and through the patterns we see in the world around us. He writes,

> So far, we have been able to clarify the concept of the study of ethics from the word _rinrigaku_. Of course, this word carries the history of ancient Chinese thought […]. However, we are not trying to bring to life an ideology of human _rin_ based on ancient Chinese social forms as they were. We are merely attempting to revive the significance of ethics as the path (*michi* [道][ja]) in human relations in order to emphasize that ethics is until the last a problem of the persistent relationships (*aidagara* [間柄][ja]) of person and person. (WTZ 10:14)

&nbsp;

In the West, depending on the author, “ethics” and “morals” are sometimes treated as synonymous and sometimes differentiated (typically with “ethics” being more social and “morals” more individual). A similar contrast exists in Japanese between _rinri_ (“ethics”) and _dōtoku_ [道徳][ja] (“morals”). Originally, _dōtoku_ was the Japanese transliteration of what is _daode_ in modern standard Mandarin, which is the same as the title of the _Daodejing_ [道德經][zh] attributed to Laozi. Much has been written about how best to translate this title into English, but roughly speaking, it concerns particular excellences or virtues (_de_) as they are situated within the broader ways or fields (_dao_) around them.[^fn2-4] This too reflects the core concern with finding a pattern or ordering woven into the fabric of our existence. Hence, whether we concern ourselves with _rinrigaku_ or _dōtokugaku_ (“moral philosophy”), our procedure will be to begin from observation of social activity.

[^fn2-4]: See Ames and Hall, _Dao De Jing_, 13--5 for more on the interpretation of the title.

Though Watsuji grounds his explanation of “ethics” in the Japanese language, an etymologically analogous understanding can also be found in the West. Aristotle writes in the _Nicomachean Ethics_,

> Virtue of character [i.e., of _ēthos_] results from habit [_ethos_]; hence its name ‘ethical,’ slightly varied from ‘ethos.’ (Book II.1, 1103a15)

In other words, ethics is ultimately founded on the giving an account ([λόγος][el]) of the way of life (ethos) of the community. A similar story can be told about “morals” and their relationship to social “mores.”[^fn2-5] 

[^fn2-5]: According to the _Oxford English Dictionary_, “Classical Latin *mōrālis* was formed by Cicero (_De Fato_ ii. i) as a rendering of ancient Greek [ἠθικός][el] (*mōrēs* being the accepted Latin equivalent of [ἤθη][el]).” See "moral, adj.". *OED Online*. June 2012. Oxford University Press. `http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/122086`.

To be sure, moral philosophy as constructed by Aristotle is significantly different from Watsuji’s anthropology of _ningen_. However, they share an important point of agreement in that whether we wish to study “ethics” or _rinrigaku_, “morals” or _dōtoku_, our investigation must start by bringing into focus the society around us.

It may be objected that the study of the patterns of human relation becomes no more than a mere sociology or physical anthropology if it does not go beyond what actually is. Surely ethics cannot rest at merely describing how a community happens to be in a given place and time. It must also describe how the community _ought_ to be. Yet, the objection goes, so long as ethicists focus exclusively on the observable, they will never understand normativity. Is this not a classic case of deriving an “ought” from an “is”? Worse still for our purposes, a theory of aesthetics that proceeds from a similar ground will be no more than a popularity contest and make merely sociological observations about the state of public taste.[^fn2-6]

[^fn2-6]: Compare Komar and Melamid’s (possibly satirical?) project *The People’s Choice* in which the “most wanted” and “least wanted” paintings and songs were created by polling people’s preferences via survey. The results are predictably awful. 

Watsuji himself acknowledges this problem, but sought to overcome it by emphasizing the dynamic aspect of ethics as a practice that both is and is not realized in our world:

> ethics is none other than the order or path (_michi_ [道][ja]) through which human communal existence is brought into being as itself. In other words, ethics is the law (_rihō_ [理法][ja]) of social existence. 
>
> However, would this not mean that ethics has already been made real as the ought? Yes and no. (WTZ10:13–4)

Ethics _is_ already realized because what ought to be is the authenticity of what already is, yet it _is not_ yet realized, for that authenticity is still a limiting horizon rather than an actual reality. That we have formed associations with others around us is a mere fact, but whether or not we have achieved the true sense of community contained within these associations as a possibility is a normative question. As Watsuji puts it, “Our ultimate origin itself is none other than the ultimate destination to which we return. This is the meaning of ‘authenticity as futurity’ (_honraisei soku miraisei_ [本来性即未来性][ja])” (WTZ 10:195--6). The authentic is always on the horizon as a possible future relationship will will realize, yet it is also the starting point of our existence. As such, understanding what is authentic must come from experience, not mere reflection. So too, it would be absurd to exclude observations of public taste as an informant of our understanding of aesthetics, just as it is absurd to elevate popularity to our sole criterion of aesthetic excellence.

Broadly speaking, if one may define “existential ethics” as the tendency of thinkers to hang their metaethics on the principle that an action is right if and only if it is an authentic expression of one’s being, then Watsuji’s ultimate metaethics may be characterized as existential. However, while many existentialists position one’s individuality as the primary locus of authenticity, authenticity for Watsuji evolves within a broader historical, geographical, and social context while also shaping that context. Hall and Ames write in _Thinking Through Confucius_,

> The existentialist perspective can be adjusted toward classical Confucianism only to the extent that it recognizes the relativity of the individual with respect to the society that determines, as well as is determined by, him. (14)

As I will show, this aptly describes the sort of modification that Watsuji has made to existentialism. He skillfully combines Confucian and Buddhist insights with Western existential thought in a way that will pave the way for a more productive understanding of aesthetics.

###The anthropology of emptiness
####Twofold character of human existence
The starting point of Watsuji’s anthropology is the recognition of the codetermination of the individual and society. Too often philosophers have taken society as no more than the aggregation of individuals, and so attempted to treat sociality as subordinate to our nature as individuals. As Watsuji begins his _Study of Ethics_:

> The primary significance of the attempt to define ethics as the study of “human beings” (*ningen* [人間][ja]) is its getting away from the misunderstanding of the modern world, which takes ethics as simply a problem of the individual consciousness. This misunderstanding is founded on the modern individualistic view of humanity. Our grasp of the individual, itself a product of the spirit of modernity, holds a great significance that we must never forget, but individualism tried to take the individual, which is one moment in human existence, and substitute it for the human totality. Its abstractness became the root of every kind of misunderstanding. The standpoint of the isolated ego taken as a starting point in modern philosophy is just one example of this. (WTZ 10:11)

&nbsp;

As useful as the Cartesian doubt was as an impetus toward the subjective turn in philosophy, ultimately, it was mistaken. Even a recluse or a Robinson Crusoe has to have been a member of some society at one time in the past in order to develop into a self-sufficient individual adult; unlike some other species, human infants are not self-sufficient. Making the individual the core unit of our analysis deliberate ignores important facts about how human beings survive as a species. Thus, according to Watsuji, although the modern subjective turn often begins with an examination of the limits of individual existence,

> if a person is authentically a social animal, then things like our persistent relationships (*aidagara* [間柄][ja]) and society should not be separated from the person. It must be the case that persons are something that while capable of being individually is also capable of being socially. And what displays this twofold characteristic best is the word *ningen* [人間][ja] (“human being”). (WTZ 10:16)

In other words, we cannot think of human beings as first isolated individuals who then somehow become entangled in relationships with one another. On the other hand, we should not think of society as a kind of super-organism of which the individual is a mere part. Instead we must think of these relationships as having equal priority to our individuality. Our relationships are just as authentic a part of us as our individuality and vice versa. This shows a basic twofold character of the human being as both individual and collective. 

The English word “human being” is translated into Japanese using the word _ningen_ [人間][ja]. It is written with two characters. The first, _nin_ [人][ja], can also be read as _hito_ and means “person” or “someone.” The second, _gen_ [間][ja], can also be read as _aida_, _ma_, or _ken_ and means a spatial or temporal interval. The term _ningen_ gained currency in the Japanese language as a Buddhist term meaning the “human realm” as distinct from the other realms of rebirth, such as the animal world or the various hells and heavens.[^fn2-7] Watsuji finds it telling that over time this term could change in its meaning from a realm to humans collectively and humans individually. One might think that this is merely an artifact of the fact that neither Japanese nor Chinese grammatically require a sharp distinction between singular and plural, but according to Watsuji, its significance is much greater. For him, the multiple usages of _ningen_ are a linguistic expression of an underlying truth about humankind as both particular ([人][ja]) and relational ([間][ja]). We are both discrete ([人][ja]) and continuous ([間][ja]). We are agents ([人][ja]) within a field of past determinations ([間][ja]). Such a usage could not have gained currency in the Japanese language if it did not reflect something of the truth about the human condition.

[^fn2-7]: The characters [人][zh] and [間][zh] (respectively _ren_ and _jian_ in modern standard Mandarin) are first attested as a compound between the Warring States and Han Dynasty periods of Chinese history, where they meant something like “being among others in society.” Dating texts from that period can be fraught with controversy, so it is difficult to assign priority of usage, but the compound can be found in _Zhuangzi_ [莊子][zh], _Shuo Yuan_ [說苑][zh], _Guanzi_ [管子][zh], etc.

####Etymology as a tool of philosophical analysis
One might object (and this objection applies as well to our earlier examination of the origins of the words “ethics” and “morals”) that these sort of Heideggerian etymological investigations, however interesting, are ultimately a matter of merely historical curiosity, and no philosophical consequences can be drawn from them. Furthermore, Watsuji seems to invest in Japanese etymology a particular importance over and above that of other languages, claiming for instance that:

> This inclination [to individualism] is, I suppose, thought to be based on how the words _anthrōpos_, _[homo][la]_, “man,” _[Mensch][de]_, etc. are only able to mean an individual person. From such a standpoint, things like the persistent relationships of person and person (*hito to hito to no aidagara* [人と人との間柄][ja]), communal existence, or society must be shown using words that distinguish from persons somehow. (WTZ 10:16)

> We [Japanese] possess the word _ningen_, which is deeply significant in this way. On the basis of its significance, we created a concept of the human being. Human beings _are_ “being in the world” (_yo no naka_ [世の中][ja]), while they _are_ also “persons” in that world. (WTZ 10:17)

In other words, Watsuji is showing a certain degree of nationalistic pride in the seeming uniqueness of the meaning of the word _ningen_ versus its western equivalents. However, in considering the general neglect of Japan by Western philosophers (then and now), we should perhaps be somewhat understanding of a certain degree of patriotic self-congratulation even as we condemn what Peter Dale calls “the myth of Japanese uniqueness” (_nihonjinron_ [日本人論][ja]) and its political implications.

To be sure, etymology is not destiny; just because a word came from a certain source historically, that does not imply that the word will continue to have an equivalent meaning henceforth or that the original meaning of a word is its “true meaning” in exclusion of its later uses. Nevertheless, there are problems with pressing this objection too strongly. First, it presumes that the historical patterns by which language changes are haphazard and that no information is produced through their evolution. To the contrary, however, if we believe that language is a tool of human thought, we should expect that the development of this tool will be in a direction that tends to maximize its practicality for human purposes, just as other human tools tend to evolve in useful directions (though not necessarily always).

Second, this objection seems to draw on an implicit portrait of philosophy as an *a priori* endeavor. On this reading, etymology is hopelessly *a posteriori* and therefore has nothing to contribute to philosophy. My own tendency is to question the usefulness of the *a priori*/*a posterori* distinction, but let us take its relevance at face value for now. Is it so clear that we must classify etymology as *a posteriori*? “All bachelors are unmarried” is analytic because of the meaning of the word “bachelor,” but meanings are things that change historically. If “water is H<sub>2</sub>O” is anything like analytic (a topic of some debate), it has become so through a process of etymological evolution. As science has evolved, we have chosen to adopt the meaning “substance composed of (mostly) H<sub>2</sub>O” for “water,” in spite of the fact that the liquids we common call water also contain hydroxyl ions, free hydrogen, dissolved gasses, various minerals, microorganisms, etc., etc. and in preference to “less scientific” but more ordinarily useful definitions such as “a clear, drinkable liquid.”[^fn2-8] It should be fairly uncontroversial that the evolution of the meaning of the word water has been towards something like a better understanding of what properties are essential for a substance to have if it is to be considered water _for our practical purposes_. Knowledge of the “essence” (the “what it is”) of a thing is gained through experience as well as ratiocination. The what-it-is of water has to be understood in reference to the what-it-is-for of water in practical experience. Through an understanding of etymology, we can see the sort of adaptations and uses that human beings have found appropriate for words, and in doing so we understand them better. Hence, by learning how ethics has evolved from ethos or _rinrigaku_ from ordered relations, we learn something about how what sorts of meanings are contained in them. So too, the evolution of _ningen_ as the Japanese word for human being conveys information that can be applied beyond a Japanese context.

[^fn2-8]: See Zemach, “Putnam’s Theory on the Reference of Substance Terms,” for a cogent criticism of Putnam’s “Brains in a Vat” on this point.

Indeed, as Watsuji explains, words themselves have a structure that illustrates the twofold character of human beings as individuals and collective, _nin_/_gen_:

> Incidentally, what we call words are one of the most uncanny things among what has been made by humans. Whatever person we should speak of, no person can be said to make words by oneself, and yet words are for each person one’s own words. This kind of character that words have is caused by their being the furnace through which the subjective (_shutai-teki_ [主体的][ja]) linkages of human beings are turned into noematic meanings. Said in other words, they are the making conscious of pre-conscious existence. (WTZ10:12)

On the one hand, words are a mechanism by which the “blooming buzzing confusion” of pre-conscious pure experience is converted into reflective consciousness. This is surely a paradigmatically individual moment in the process of experience. Yet at the same time what mediates this moment of individual experience are words that have come to the individual through the community. Words are for each of us our own words, yet our words are always the words of the others who gave them their beginnings of meaning in the distant etymological past. In this way, language itself clearly illustrates the central claim of Watsuji’s anthropology: that human existence is always both social and individual.

####Negating individuality and totality
The double nature of words as individually and collectively possessed vividly illustrates Watsuji’s contention that,

> Individual persons *do not subsist* in themselves. […] *Neither does* a total agent *subsist* in itself. […] It follows that individual persons subsist in a linkage with totality. […] It follows that we must find that the total agent as well *subsists* in a linkage with the independence of individuals. (WTZ 10:106)

It may seem strange to assert that individual persons do not subsist in themselves. Common sense in the modern West tells us that individuals are ontologically prior to the communities they choose to form through a social contract. However, in the chapter “Moments of Individualism in Human Existence” (WTZ 10:62--92) from _The Study of Ethics_, Watsuji searches for this ontologically prior individual without success. We may try to think of the human body as an independent physical substance, but this way of thinking clashes with our everyday experience. As Watsuji illustrates, 

> When we spot a friend waiting for us by a bronze statue, it’s not that we find as an immediately given fact a solid object with the same form as the statue. From the first, we *find our friend*. (WTZ 10:68)

We discover the person of our friend and not a mere object, yet this does not occur through some inferential process by which observe the object of our friend and then conclude that there must be an invisible soul animating her body. Rather, “the motion of the subjective body (_shutai_ [主体][ja]) is the motion of the physical body, without the slightest gap between the subjective and physical bodies” (WTZ 10:68). When we investigate the nature of the human body, we discover its existence as an acting subject, and as an acting subject, our bodies are linked in relationships. I see *my friend* by the statue. I greet *the driver* as I get on board the bus. I watch *a stranger* walk passed me on the sidewalk. As subjects, our bodies are already connected in a web of relationships and roles. I greet my friend with an embrace, my driver with a nod, and the stranger not at all. The more we continue investigating the acting subjects around us, the more we find our supposed independence from them vanishes:

> To the degree that it is able to form relationships, the physical body is something connected to other physical bodies; to the degree that its connection to other bodies is exhaustively destroyed, it either returns to being *a solid object unable to form relationships* or it returns to *absolute emptiness*. (WTZ 10:71)

Hence our individuality as subjects cannot cash out in our independence as physical objects without either nihilistically cutting off our personhood or admitting the emptiness of individuality itself.

If this is so, perhaps we should look for our individuality in the mind rather than the body. However, there too our search fails. Language is a core aspect of thought, yet, as was shown, the language *I* use is inevitably the language *we* use, because words are both individual and communal. Watsuji notes that according to Johann Gottlieb Fichte (1762--1814), the independence of consciousness

> is like thinking of the self that sees the wall when one is alone in one’s study looking at a wall all by oneself. However, if in this case one is conscious of *the wall as a wall*, social consciousness has already infiltrated into it. (WTZ 10:77)

The aspectival nature of perception means that ordinary consciousness is far from independent. Rather, it utilizes the concepts and categories it receives from others (in this case, “wall”). Clearly this will have implications for the purity of aesthetics experience that I will have to explore more in later chapters. Even in wordless feelings, my consciousness is connected with the consciousness of the other:

> It cannot be that the consciousness of the *I* who feels the beauty of a picture and the consciousness of Thou towards the same picture are completely independent things. We are feeling the same beauty together. The difference in the way that two people feel can only be compared on the ground of this shared feeling. (WTZ 10:76)

If even my private feelings of aesthetic satisfaction or dissatisfaction are shared with others, what is left of my individuality? All we can say is that our individuality is a kind of limit that we reach when we take a contextual field of relationships and attempt to remove that context in order to focus more tightly on the central locus of those relationships. But, like the axis around which a top spins, there is nothing in that center point that accounts for the motion swirling around it, and too close of a focus on it will only mislead us. Watsuji concludes, “It follows that individuality itself has no established existence; *its essence is negation and is emptiness*” (WTZ 10:85).

Having negated the individual as a substantial entity, one may then hypothesize that some sort of super-individual self is ontologically prior, and individual human beings are just parts of this communal or social whole. However, Watsuji also denies this supposition. In the chapter “Moments of Totality in Human Existence” (WTZ 10:92--106), Watsuji finds that communal wholes are just as lacking in substantiality as the individual whole was. The difficulty is that there is no singular super-individual whole to which an individual belongs. The same person may be both a father _and_ a son. One person can be both a wife *and* a citizen or a worker *and* a student. The result of this multiplicity of non-overlapping identities is that for a family,

> the way in which it reveals its whole is utterly different from the manner in which a hand as a part of the body is a hand through its revealing the whole. A hand is a hand and *cannot be anything else but a hand*. However, the members of a family are people *who could be something else* but are limited to this particular capacity. (WTZ 10:95)

My hand is a part of my body alone. It is not a part of my body and also a part of some other body. Individuals, however, do belong to multiple wholes from families and communities, up to nation states. A hand is just a part made of parts, but a human being plays many different parts in many different relationships. The possibility of being something other than what one is pervades each of the social roles we play. How can it be then that social wholes have truly substantial existence if they cannot even maintain exclusive possession of their constituent parts?[^fn2-9]

[^fn2-9]: Incidentally, this is the reason it is strictly speaking inaccurate to classify Watsuji as a “totalitarian” as is sometimes done by his critics. While this is no defense of Watsuji’s overall political commitments, it should be noted that strictly speaking Watsuji does not believe that human beings only have meaning within a larger totality that is self-evidently meaningful.

As the result of his investigation of the various attempts to understand the totality of which the individual is supposedly just a part, Watsuji concludes that, “The real truth is that something like a total being that precedes the individual and prescribes it as an individual---‘a great totality’---does not subsist” (WTZ 10:106).

####The self in and through persistent relationships
Since neither individuals nor “society” as a totality have truly independent existence, this means that they are both “empty” in the sense of lacking an independent substantiality not derived from a more fundamental relationality. In other words,

> If we take this to be so, then both the individual person and the totality are things *that do not subsist in themselves but merely subsist in their linkage with the other*. (WTZ 10:106)

At an ultimate level, to be an individual is to be a part of a larger whole, and to be a larger whole is to be made up of various individuals. Both the individual and the whole exist within a larger field of possible relationships, and, “Neither is able to be ‘prior’ ” (WTZ 10:107).

Watsuji explains the reason this search for substantiality failed is that it is only by putting the persistent relationships (_aidagara_ [間柄][ja]) of person and person first ontological that we can solve the nagging problem of subject and object relations. _Aidagara_ is written using the same character, [間][ja], as the _gen_ in _ningen_, which, as mentioned above indicates a spatial or temporal interval, plus _gara_, which means a recurring pattern.[^fn2-10] _Aidagara_, then, is a kind of field or space in which our persistent relationships with others repeatedly occur. It is called by some translators the “betweenness” of person and person. (I prefer to emphasize its recurring relational dimension by translating it as “persistent relationships.”) Shogakukan’s _Ruigo Reikai Jiten_ Japanese thesaurus notes that unlike the word _kankei_ [関係][ja], which is also often translated as “relationship,” _aidagara_ indicates an enduring relationship, hence one would not use it in expressions like, “lose one’s relationship” or “break off the relationship” as one would with _kankei_. _Aidagara_ are persistent relationships---such as familial bonds---which cannot be severed merely through a change of attitude or circumstance. Recall the five relationships, or _gorin_, of Confucianism. In our lives, these relationships proceed our existence (one cannot exist as a child without some relation to a parent), but we also play a part in creating, sustaining, and redefining these relationships (a parent cannot be a parent without having had a child). For this reason, we go awry if we try to give ontological priority to the individual over its persistent relationships. <!--Soseki’s hashi?-->

[^fn2-10]: As a suffix, _gara_ is often used to indicate recurring patterns, such as the patterns on clothing. For instance, a tiger striped shirt is _toragara_ [虎柄][ja] from _tora_ “tiger” plus _gara_. Hence when combined with _aida_, it gives the sense of an interval that repeatedly unfolds according to a persistent design.

Applying this at the level of ethics, Watsuji finds the “fundamental law of human existence” (_ningen sonzai no kompon rihō_ [人間存在の根本理法][ja]) is that individuals must negate the totality to which they belong in order to individuate themselves but they must negate that negation in order to return to the totality. He writes,

> Totality is said to be established in the negation of the individual, but it cannot come out of the negation of a single individual alone. Individuals are many, and by casting off their individuality, those many individuals become one, and thereby a totality is established as a communal existence. However, in no totality whatsoever can we say that individuality is completely extinguished. So soon as the negated individual becomes an individual once more by negating totality, the movement of negation repeats anew. Totality subsists *only in this movement*. (WTZ 10:27)

In other words, human existence is fundamentally a dynamic process in which we are never frozen into a static existence as self-defined individuals or socially constructed roles.  When we act, we act in conformance to society or in opposition to society and through acting, we redefine ourselves and the roles society has for us. Neither totality nor individuality has substantial existence alone, but both become through dynamic opposition. 

For Watsuji, this dynamic process of interplay between the self as individual and the self as communal is the source of human authenticity. To be a human being means being part of 

> an incessant movement that individuates through division from something communal and comes back to its authenticity (_honraisei_ [本来性][ja]) through realizing community as the negation of something individuated. (WTZ 10:195)[^fn2-11]

[^fn2-11]: The word _honrai_ [本来][ja] is composed of characters meaning “coming from the root,” and it is also translated as “origin.” Hence _honraisei_ [本来性][ja] not only means “authenticity,” it also carries the suggestion that “authenticity” is a natural outgrowth of the root of our being. For this reason, Watsuji often refers to it as a “return.” Nevertheless, this return is not a mere reversion to an original state, but a creative return with difference as that root comes to grow in new and different ways. The root gets bigger as the tree grows.

As a result, 

> we are able to define the fundamental principle of the study of ethics in its most universal sense as “the movement in which absolute negativity returns to the self through negation.” (WTZ 10:125)

Goodness, according to Watsuji, is the circumstance in which our true aspect can reveal itself through the continuation of this process. He writes, “The highest value is an absolute totality, and an ‘aspiration’ (an upward impulse or fervent wish) for it is ‘good’ (_zen_ [善][ja])” (WTZ 10:142).[^fn2-12] In other words, though we may think of the unactualizable true absolute as having the highest value, goodness does not consist in the static possession of such an absolute. Rather, goodness comes about through *movement* towards the absolute. Growth is the chief good of human existence. Badness, on the other hand, comes from a premature halting of the process of double negation. Either placing the individual over society or placing society over the individual is wrong insofar as it attempts to freeze a dynamic process in place and betrays its authentic nature as evolving. Ethical goodness is an efficacy or virtuosity of performance rather than a rigid conformance to a fixed disposition. In the coming chapters, I will show that aesthetic goodness has a similarly dynamic meaning.

[^fn2-12]: “Aspiration” is English in the original, but Bernard Bernier speculates Watsuji uses it as “the English rendition of _[Nachhängen][de]_, a word used by Heidegger in the sense of ‘projection from inside toward’ something” (_National Communion_, 100, n. 10). On the other hand, compare _Book of Changes_, _Xici_ 5, “The unifying of *yin* and unifying of *yang* is called *dao* and the continuity thereof is good” ([一陰一陽之謂道，繼之者善也][zh]). Whether Watsuji had this particular passage in mind or not, this passage and others make clear that Watsuji’s ethical vision shares with _Book of Changes_ the worldview that goodness resides in the development of novelty, not the achievement of a particular final state.

####Negation and emptiness as limitation and possibility
Clearly, negation is the centerpiece of Watsuji’s philosophical anthropology, but what exactly is negation? As an ordinary example, one might think of the process by which one defines one’s identity by rebelling against external constraints. Think for instance of a toddler in the “Terrible Twos” or a teenage rebel. These are ordinary phases of personal development, and in a well-integrated personality, they eventually come to an end as one makes peace with one’s surroundings. One negates the other in rebellion to establish the self, but then eventually surrenders the self to the community as one makes peace with society. On the other hand, at a more metaphysical extreme, one might think of negation as a Hegelian process of dialectic. The individual self is first created as a thesis but eventually sublated with its communal antithesis into a novel synthesis as the dialectic moves forward historically. 

Both of these senses capture something of what Watsuji means by negation: the mundane and the esoteric. However, negation must also be understood through a specifically Japanese cultural lens. Watsuji clearly means for “negation” to be understood in the context of [Nishida][sc] Kitarō’s “self-identity of absolute contradiction” (_zettai mujun-teki jiko dōitsu_ [絶対矛盾的自己同一][ja]) and the Buddhist doctrine of emptiness. Watsuji writes, for instance, that, “in the extremity in which we seek the individual independence of the physical body, we break through to *the disappearance of individual independence*. In another field, this has also been expressed with the phrase ‘the dropping off of body-mind’ ” (WTZ 10:71). This refers to the teachings of Sōtō Zen monk Dōgen Kigen ([道元希玄][ja], 1200--1253), whose work Watsuji popularized in his monograph _Monk Dōgen_.[^fn1-13] Watsuji is claiming that a truly penetrative insight into individuality, as is gained for instance in Zen meditation, leads one to a realization of the non-duality of the body and mind with the world around it. Watsuji also writes about _aidagara_ that,

[^fn1-13]: _Monk Dōgen_ is _Shamon Dōgen_ ([沙門道元][ja], 1926), available in WTZ 4:156--246. A translation by Steve Bein is available under the title *Purifying Zen*. 

> That is, already existing persistent relationships (*aidagara* [間柄][ja]) are ultimately the absolute totality of self-other non-duality. They are the *authentic countenance* before your mother and father were born. They are *authenticity* as the origin out of which we ultimately come. (WTZ 10:195)

In Zen Buddhism, one’s “authentic countenance” is the true self apart from the conceptual discriminations that obscure it. The absolute totality consists of non-discrimination between self and other. This non-discrimination is on the one hand an accomplishment made through dedicated practice, but at the same time, non-discrimination is a return to what it is authentic and original for the human being: the matrix of relationships out of which one emerged as a putative individual. We treat the self and other as two separate things, but fundamentally they are non-dual. Their apparent duality is only the middle phase of a larger process that begins and ends with non-differentiation.

We may say then that both human beings and the communities to which they belong are “empty” of inherent existence. In Buddhism, emptiness (*kū* [空][ja]) means that things lack the substantiality that we seek in them, and as a result, life is unsatisfactory. Negation in its ultimate meaning cannot be just negation of individual or negation of the community, because for either sort of negation to be final, the thing negated would have to have its own ontological priority. Watsuji writes, “the individual is one who becomes an individual as the negation of *emptiness from which the self originates* (that is, authentic emptiness)” (WTZ 10:124). That is, the fundamental law of human beings is ultimately the negation of emptiness itself. In the process of double negation, emptiness is our source and our destination.

Based on the preceding discussion, I propose the following explanation of emptiness and negation. Emptiness is an open field of possibilities. Negation is a limitation or determination of possibility. Initially, there is a manifold field of possibilities based on past determinations ([空][ja]). Out of that field, an agent ([人][ja]) arises as the limitation of the self and other (*jita* [自他][ja]). This is the individuating moment of double negation. It is followed by a moment of communalization in which the individual reintegrates into the totality ([間][ja]). The reintegrated totality can now be taken as the field of possibilities in which future determinations will be made. Our freedom as individuals comes from our location within the process of determination and determining.

If I may coin a term, I wish to call this a process of cleavage: cleaving apart and cleaving together. I use the term “cleavage” because the word “cleave” is in the class of words known as auto-antonyms, along with “dust” (to sprinkle dust or to sweep away dust), “sanction” (to permit an act or to penalize it), and others. “Cleave” has two senses: to create a division and unite a division. Etymologically, in fact, these two senses are distinct: cleave apart was once pronounced “clove” and cleave together was once pronounced “clive.”[^fn1-14] Around the fourteenth century these two pronunciations came together, and in doing so produced a new sense. To cleave is to create a cleavage. A cleavage is a line of differentiation without separation. If there is a cleavage in a rock, we can see that the rock is divided into two, but at the same time the rocks are one. The same is true in the process of double cleavage in human existence. I am divided from the other, but our fundamental non-duality remains. History is the accumulation of cleavage between person and person, in which past cleavages create a space of possibility for new divisions and old divisions become obscured by a tighter unity. Past divisions restrict my freedom to the extent that they limit the possibilities that I can choose from as an agent, but at the same time these past divisions are the core of my freedom because without them I would not exist as an agent capable of determining future limitations.

####Emptiness vs. reductionism
In *Translation and Subjectivity*, Naoki Sakai criticizes Watsuji’s invocation of emptiness, on the grounds that it makes him “reductionist” about persons. On Sakai’s reading, Watsuji’s person is no more than the social construction that makes him or her up. However, he writes, this will not do because,

> Not only am I an other to myself (Watsuji was fully aware of this sort of otherness, which can easily be contained by the scheme of _shutai_ or subjectivity), but I am also other to the dual structure of subjectivity; that is, my relation to myself always bears a surplus value that is irreducible to the dual structure of the whole and the individual. Thus, I am never reduced to an identity, an individual who identifies with the whole. I am not a unity fashioned after the unicity of the whole. In short, I am not an *individuum*. (98)

Sakai’s criticism of Watsuji echoes contemporary critiques launched by [Miki][sc] Kiyoshi ([三木清][ja], 1897--1945), a leftist philosopher eventually imprisoned by the wartime authorities for his writings.[^fn2-15] Miki explains in “The Study of the Human,”

> First, even if one were to decide on “the study of human beings” as a satisfactory definition for philosophical anthropology, the object of study to which the term itself points cannot in fact be defined like other things. […] The fact that real human beings can never simply be defined in such a way provides the _raison d’être_ for a different way to study the human being. (702--3)

[^fn2-15]: See Chiaro Brivio’s dissertation “The Human Being” for a more thorough comparison of the two thinkers.

Miki raises a key point, namely that the human being should not be considered a mere object of scientific inquiry, but Sakai’s reading of Watsuji misses a crucial aspect of emptiness. Recall that I previously quoted Watsuji that, “in no totality whatsoever can we say that individuality is completely extinguished” (WTZ 10:27). This is because “emptiness” in the East Asian tradition is not merely a void but a plenum of creative possibility. _Kū_ [空][ja] is a form of “openness” as much as it a sheer “void.” In the famous words of the Heart Sutra, “Form is not different than emptiness; emptiness is not different than form. Form _just is_ emptiness; emptiness _just is_ form” ([色不異空、空不異色、色即是空、空即是色][zh]). In other words, not only does form lack substance, this lack of substance is what gives rise to form. To give another famous Buddhist slogan, _[śūnyatā][sa]_ (Sanskrit, “emptiness”) is equivalent to universal _[pratītyasamutpāda][sa]_ (“dependent co-arising”): no phenomena stands on its own, but through their confluence, new phenomena arise. Emptiness does not just mean that society defines the individual such that the individual is reducible to its social construction. The individual also constructs society, so that society is, in a certain sense, reducible to the individuals that make it up. Watsuji explains that

> relational existence (*aidagara-teki sonzai* [間柄的存在][ja]) is in the standpoint of common sense already grasped from two points of view. One is that *persistent relationships are formed in the “betweenness”* (aida [間][ja]) *or “fellowship”* (naka [仲][ja]) *of particular persons*. From this direction, there must be the particular members who preceded the relation. The other is that *the members who made the persistent relationship are limited as members by the persistent relation itself*. Seen from this direction, preceding the particular members, there must be a persistent relationship that defined them. These two relations (*kankei* [関係][ja]) contradict each other. Yet these contradictory relations are recognized as commonsense facts. (WTZ 10:61)

Put differently, there are two “directions” of emptying. The existence of these two directions of emptiness produces the creative contradiction leading to the “surplus value” that Sakai and Miki rightly insist we preserve in our anthropology. From the top down perspective, we can attempt to define individuals in terms of those larger entities that mold them. From a Marxist perspective, we might talk about how the individual is a pawn in the struggle between classes; or, from a nationalist perspective, we might talk about how individuals are mere instantiations of some larger national or ethnic character. On the other hand, from a bottom up perspective, we can attempt to define individuals in terms of those smaller entities that constitute them. From a biological perspective, we contain certain cell structures; or from a chemical perspective, we are made of collections of particular molecules. Buddhist emptiness is non-reductive because it denies the finality of either top down or bottom up reductions. It charts a “Middle Way” between nihilism and substantivism by turning these two directions of reduction against one another.

It is true that we are molded by larger social structures. It is from the top down perspective that we can talk about the subject as having a “mind” studied by psychology. From this perspective, society is an observable outer reality, and mind is a hidden inner reality. It is also true that we are constituted by smaller physical entities. It is from the bottom up perspective that we can talk about the subject as having a “body” studied by the natural sciences. From this perspective, the body is an observable outer reality, and sub-atomic particles are a hidden inner reality. The tension between these two perspectives is not unilaterally resolvable. Both are ultimately lacking in substance when explored in sufficient depth, and this non-dual emptiness leads to the overflow of value that is celebrated by Miki and Sakai and is the focal point of aesthetics. Emptiness itself is irreducibly reducible without thereby being univocally and statically determined. Rather, it expresses itself as the novel dynamism of the interplay of the two directions of possible reduction. The importance of this for aesthetics is that it means our experiences will not merely be a collection of decomposable parts nor unitary, given wholes. Experience can exhibit creativity through its lack of substance. Hence the outcome of Watsuji’s emptying of the subject is not to reduce the self to society, but to allow it to fill itself out as relations are fleshed out existentially.

###Methodology of cleavage in everyday existence
The pattern of double negation in human existence can be understood as an instance of a more general pattern of hermeneutic cleavage: first there is an undifferentiated whole, then its division, and finally the reunion of the parts without a reversion to the origin. Watsuji states that “human existence itself is a movement that realizes its authentic unity in the linkage of unity/division/combination (_tōitsu/bunri/ketsugō_ [統一・分離・結合][ja])” (WTZ 10:40).  Because this pattern underlies human existence, the only way to come to understand the structure of the human being---and hence the grounds for aesthetics as a discipline---is through “the hermeneutic method of restoration/construction/destruction (_kangen/kōsei/hakai_ [還元・構成・破壊][ja])” (WTZ 10:49)[^fn2-16] that reverses this process. We restore when we return to the moment of non-conscious combination of self and other as we feel it in everyday experience. We construct a subject by isolating a focus from the field which surrounds it and calling that abstracted focus the self. Finally, we destroy or deconstruct when we reintegrate the focus into the field and recognize their primordial unity. 

[^fn2-16]: _Kangen_ is also translated as “reduction.” For example, see Yamamoto and Carter, 45. However, as explained in the last section, this translation creates a misleading understanding of Watsuji’s project. Taken literally, the characters [還元][ja] mean a “return to the origin,” or as Watsuji writes about _kangen_, “from expressions, it goes back to what was expressed, that is, back to human existence” (WTZ 10:48). The point is not to “reduce” human existence to expressions or vice-versa but to restore by means of expressions our ability to focus attention on lived human existence.

Watsuji’s understanding of hermeneutics is heavily influenced by his teacher at Tokyo Imperial University, Raphael von Koeber (1848--1923), who imparted in his students an appreciation of the work of Wilhelm Dilthey (1833--1911) and other German thinkers.[^fn1-koeber] Dilthey was part of a wave of philosophers and philologists who sought to establish hermeneutics as “the science of interpretation,” in which our understanding of the relationship between the text as a part and the text as a whole could be progressively enhanced. According to Ronald Bontekoe in *Dimensions of the Hermeneutic Circle*, Dilthey’s basic theory is that “the relationship between an expression and the mental content that it reveals is fixed by a common order of socially determined associations, which in turn is grounded in the commonness of human nature” (54--5). Furthermore, “given our common human nature, there will be standard meanings, the relevant expressions for which we will be able to determine inductively” (55). Watsuji’s basic methodological assumptions are the same as Dilthey’s. He hopes to work out a progressively more comprehensive theory of the nature of the human being by using concrete expressions as point of entry. Where Watsuji differs from Dilthey is that Watsuji takes society as something just as subjective as the individual.[^fn2-maraldo]

[^fn1-koeber]: Watsuji’s reflections on the life and teachings of Professor Koeber are contained in *Professor Koeber*, *Keeberu Sensei* [ケーベル先生][ja], WTZ 6:1--39.

</figure>

As illustrated by figure one, unity/division/combination and destruction/construction/restoration are parallel to the pattern of double negation at work in human existence. As human beings, we come from a place of betweenness where there are no defined boundaries between self and other. There is a difference between our core and those around us (as symbolized by the gradient from black to white), but this difference is a vague one with no bright line of discontinuity, only opposing poles. This is the first phase, unity. Then in negation we carve out a space between our self and our surroundings. We oppose those around us and so define ourselves. We abstract the content from its context and separate the focus from its field. This is the second phase, division. In the third phase, we bring self and other together in combination to form a community. As individuals, we reconcile ourselves to society. Notice, however, that the marks of cleavage remain even after this reunion. After this, the cycle continues again with the former combination forming the ground of unity for a new cycle as we continually define and redefine through action our relations with others and objects.

Because of this, our investigation of aesthetics must begin with a “restoration” (_kangen_ [還元][ja], a return to the combination of self and other in everyday life) in which we grasp everyday experiences as expressions of our existence. These expressions show us just how the combination of self and other is accomplished around us. As Watsuji says,

> there is no mine so rich as what is called the everyday experience of human beings. Walking through town, a variety of goods are displayed on shelves. Common sense already *knows from its gut* what kind they are, what they are used for, how to buy them, and so on. Yet there is not a one of these goods that is not somehow an expression of human existence. (WTZ 10:42)

> In other words, as expressions what we call “*everyday life*” provides a variety of ways routes into human existence. Thus we are able to take “facts” in the most commonsensical and naïve sense as our point of departure. (WTZ 10:43)

&nbsp;

To be sure, as mentioned previously, should we merely observe the patterns of everyday existence without going any deeper, then aesthetics would be the mere study of public opinion---this kind of art is popular, this kind of is unpopular, some people like this, others do not, and so forth. We go beyond merely sociologically describing cultural patterns in aesthetics when we start to see how everyday experiences are expressions of a deeper structure of humanity and grasp that structure. Restoration is crucial to the understanding, but since human existence is a positive, dynamic interplay between individuality and sociality, we cannot get a complete grasp of human existence through negative, restorative reflection alone. We cannot, so to speak, understand aesthetics only from the armchair; a purely theoretical aesthetics would rapidly become disconnected from life as it is. We must also also live these expressions *constructively* while detaching ourselves from them if they are to go beyond static understanding into dynamic realization in space and time. 

Finally, through this preparation we are able to deconstruct our experiences and grasp the structure of unity in human existence in its most general form. In this final step of the hermeneutic process, we attempt to “return what it is that is transmitted in everyday expressions to the spring that created them” (WTZ 10:49). Though there is a danger that our understanding will still be limited by the particularities of the cultural data through which we attempt to understand them, “self-awareness (_jikaku_ [自覚][ja]) of particularity is the only path (*michi* [道][ja]) by which to go beyond particularities” (WTZ 10:49).

To give a few analogies, in mathematics, there are axioms, facts, and a logic that allows us to draw new facts out of our axioms. To make mathematical progress, we must begin by returning our attention to those axioms that are given to us in intuition in such a way that they seem indispensable, work out the facts that are constructed as implications of those axioms, and only then may we remark at the highest level of abstraction about the logic that has been invisibly supporting this structure all along, before returning to begin the hermeneutic cycle of understanding anew. In linguistics, we all have an intuitive sense of which sentences “sound right” and which do not, we refine these intuitions into sets of rules for particular languages by constructing a grammar, and finally, we go beyond the boundaries of particular languages in an effort to understand the universal grammar of human languages. In ethics, we begin by observing seemingly self-evident moral intuitions in practice in ordinary life, we work out the theoretical implications of our moral intuitions as applied to new situations, and finally we begin to understanding something of the nature of practical reason as it gives itself to us in appearance. At the most general level, we are faced with practice, theory, and reason as three interlocking and inseparable areas of concern that must be understood in an on-going hermeneutic circle.

The fundamental method of aesthetics must be the same. Accordingly in chapter three (“Aesthetic Experience as Distancing, Dissolution, and Disinterest”), I will attempt to restore our focus aesthetic experience in everyday experience, in chapters four (“The Subject and Object in Aesthetic Normativity”) and five (“Art, History, and Milieu”), I will attempt to construct again a framework for understanding the subject and object of aesthetic normativity and theories of art, and in chapter six (“Beyond the Bounds of Aesthetics: Criticism, Genius, and Culture”), I will attempt to go beyond a culturally particular understanding to uncover one of the universal aspects of aesthetics in and through particularity.

Along the way, each chapter will be supplemented with an illustration of its arguments using examples taken from Japanese art history in order to give a concrete example of my theories. That I use primarily *Japanese* art history is mostly a matter of personal convenience---I am relatively familiar with the subject and Watsuji frequently commented on it, making it easier for me to show what he would have thought about the topic---but there is also benefit to be had in the fact that most of Japanese art history has been independent of Western philosophical influence. Because Japan has only been open to influence from Western philosophy for the past century and half, the theories underpinning the self-understanding of its artists tend to be different from Western theories of aesthetics in a way that makes it easier to illustrate my arguments about the aesthetics of cleavage.
