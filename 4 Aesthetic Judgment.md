##Chapter 4. The Subject and Object of Aesthetic Judgment and Taste
###From my feelings to our judgments
In the last chapter, our hermeneutic inquiry into aesthetics began with an attempt to “restore” our understanding of aesthetic experience against the backdrop of everyday experience. An aesthetic experience is an experience of disinterested enjoyment through the dynamic interplay of distancing and dissolution. This experience goes beyond the ordinary self to the unity of no-self before the creation of subject-object duality.

Aesthetics, however, does not end with this experience. When an experience is through, we feel an urgent need to communicate the content of this experience to others and share the experience with them. This reintroduces the subject and object to aesthetics. On the basis of my aesthetic experience, I, the subject, judge the object to be beautiful or ugly, lovely or disgusting, sublime or mundane, and I hope to persuade you to judge likewise. 

But what is it about *my* aesthetic experience that creates a basis for *our* judgment? Vice versa, how can the tastes of others be the basis for my own experiences? What is the source aesthetic agreement? How is it that there are such things as communities of taste? How can deference to the tastes of others possibly be an authentic expression of my subjectivity? Is there anything like normativity in aesthetic judgment or can we only describe our own aesthetic feelings without prescribing them for others? Is aesthetic judgment universal, relative, or something else?

To answer these questions, in this chapter I will go beyond just describing the experience of aesthetics as _kansei_ [感性][ja] or sensibility and begin to explain aesthetics as _bigaku_ [美学][ja]---the study of beautiful things and our judgments about them.[^fn4-1] _Bigaku_ itself can be thought of as proceeding from two directions of inquiry. Going from the individual to the communal, we may ask how intensely personal and immediate aesthetic experiences can be basis for propositions to which we expect others to assent. Call this “the problem of aesthetic judgment.” Going from communal to individual, we may ask how the tastes of a community can be the basis for an individual experience. Call this “the problem of taste.” Resolving these problems requires us to follow the second step in the hermeneutic methodology outlined in the second chapter, namely construction. Because aesthetic judgment is a form of judgment, it can only be made within the context of a cleanly separated subject and object, unlike aesthetic experience, which aims to get back to the unity that precedes the split. A judgment takes an individual experience and makes it the basis for a group assent. We create a subject in order to look at the object from outside and evaluate it then we present that evaluation to others. Tastes, on the other hand, are a means by which a group comes to prescribe experiences for individuals to have toward certain objects, hence tastes also require the existence of a certain structure in the arrangement of subject and object.

[^fn4-1]: Recall Stephen Pepper’s distinction between “particular immediate experience” and “the judgment of esthetic taste” mentioned in the last chapter (“The Esthetic Object,” 477).

In this chapter I will first examine more closely at the nature of subject and the nature of the object as they co-construct one another as experience. Then I will show how these natures allow for the creation of normativity in aesthetic judgment without requiring us to posit a universal, rational taste. Finally, I will present examples from traditional Japanese arts, particularly linked verse, that illustrate my contentions about the nature of the self, judgments, and taste. What we will find is that subjects are active and plural, objects are impermanent and insistent, judgments must be subjective yet normative, and tastes can be authentic though communal.

###Who is the subject?
####Subject as agent
As mentioned in chapter two, Naoki Sakai is critical of what he feels is Watsuji’s project of “reducing” the subject to a twofold structure of individual and community as _ningen_ [人間][ja] (“human beings”). While I feel that Sakai’s criticisms are somewhat wide of the mark, he does do a service for readers who are primarily familiar with Watsuji in translation by drawing attention to aspects of Watsuji’s philosophy that might otherwise be lost in translation. In *Translation and Subjectivity*, Sakai notes that the word “subject” has many renderings in Japanese:

> _Shutai_ [[主体][ja]] was introduced into Japanese intellectual vocabulary as a neologism, as one of the translations for “subject,” _sujet_, or _Subjekt_, other translations being _shugo_ [[主語][ja]] (propositional subject), _shukan_ [[主観][ja]] (epistemic subject), _shudai_ [[主題][ja]] (thematic subject), _shinmin_ [[臣民][ja]] (subject of the emperor), among others. (119)

While most of these ambiguities are fairly clear even to readers whose primary language is English (the subject of a sentence is plainly a different thing than the subject of a king), those who read Watsuji only in translation are apt to miss the distinction he makes between _shutai_ [主体][ja] and _shukan_ [主観][ja] and interpret him as having an inconsistent attitude towards subjectivity and subjectivism. In both words, the _shu_ [主][ja] represents the host or ruler as opposed to a “guest” (_kyaku_ [客][ja] from which comes “objectivity,” _kyakkan-sei_ [客観性][ja]). <!--relativity of shu-kaku?∞-->The _kan_ of _shukan_ means to look or to observe, hence _shukan_ indicates the subject as one who passively receives sense data. The _tai_ of _shutai_, on the other hand, means a physical body or the unit of a larger whole.[^fn4-2] The suggestion of _shutai_ as opposed to _shukan_ is that of a body at work among other bodies instead of an isolated observer. _Shutai_ indicates the subject as embodied agent who is a practical and active, hence Geoffrey Bownas sometimes renders _shutai_ as “self-active body” and other times as just “subject.”[^fn4-3] Sakai writes,

[^fn4-2]: In _Climate and Culture_, which is Bownas’s translation of the work I refer to elsewhere as Watsuji’s _Milieu_.

[^fn4-3]: The character for _tai_ in _shutai_ was written as [體][zh] in the pre-war orthography, which reflects the close connection between the physical body and Confucian _li_ [禮][zh] (ritual propriety). In post-war Japanese orthography and mainland Chinese simplified characters, _tai_ was standardized as [体][zh], which had existed beforehand as a handwritten variant. This way of writing _tai_ is meant to show that the body is the root ([本][zh]) of the person ([人][zh]).

> The term “subject” or _shutai_ itself was thus posited as the central philosopheme around which topics related to praxis, on the one hand, and the determination of particular social relations, on the other, would be woven together in Watsuji’s study of the human being. (79)

When translating Western works on the nature of the subject into Japanese, those works that consider the subject to be ultimately a passive transcendental observer tend to be translated using _shukan_, but those under the influence from Marx, Nietzsche, and other sources in which the subject is regarded as an active embodied agent are translated using _shutai_. [Nishida][sc] Kitarō’s theory of active intuition (*kōi-teki chokkan* [行為的直観][ja]) in particular was crucial in bringing out this aspect of the subject.[^fn4-4] For our purposes, the critical aspect of _shutai_ is that it shows the importance of the living body as the ground of the human being and the importance of active engagement as well as passive contemplation. 

[^fn4-4]: Sakai, *Translation and Subjectivity*, 213, n. 4 notes that the interest in _shutai_ expressed by Watsuji and others can be traced to Nishida, especially _Nishida Kitarō Zenshū_ 6:341--427.

In _Study of Ethics_ Watsuji makes it clear that seeing the subject as “ ‘one who observes objects,’ that is, the _shukan_” leads to philosophical difficulties in ethics because “the problem of human existence, the problem of linkages of conduct and practice have no connection to the aforementioned isolated _shukan_” (WTZ 10:11). That is, the most central philosophical puzzles to be resolved---those related to ethics, value, and meaning---stem primarily from the subject as _shutai_ and not from the subject as _shukan_.  While the view of the subject as observer has its place---certainly theorizing is a part of human existence---it is a *[déformation professionnelle][fr]* to so valorize the arm chair that we give it priority over practical action in our understanding of human existence. As mentioned in chapter two, a common thread in East Asian thought is Wang Yangming’s slogan _zhixing heyi_ [知行合一][zh], “Unity of knowledge and practice.” Watsuji is similarly critical of Cartesian thinking in which one sits in one’s study and attempts to prove the existence of the other. The attempt shows its own superfluousness in the writing:

> _Writing_ “only the _I_ is a certainty” is a self-contradiction because writing is the expression in letters of words, and words are something that develop only when one has a partner to live with and speak with.  (WTZ 10:52)

We forget that there’s no one out there who could read our disproof of solipsism without already disbelieving in solipsism because we neglect the importance of the body and its practical conduct in favor of a view of the subject as observer. In aesthetics as well, we must be careful not to elevate the observing subject over the agentive subject if we are to escape the pitfall of neglecting the importance of action to forming judgments.

One approach to talking about norms in aesthetic judgment has been to couch claims about what constitutes good and bad taste in terms of the reactions of a hypothetical “suitable spectator” or an “ideal observer.” In this framework, good taste is that judgment offered by an ideal observer. The “correct” judgment to render about an aesthetic question just is one that agrees with an ideal observer. Richard Wollheim, for example, claims in “On Pictorial Representation” that we can judge the success of representation in a picture on the basis of whether, “if a suitable spectator looks at the picture, he will, other things equal, have the appropriate experience” (396).<!--other people?∞--> However, from the perspective on the subject just mentioned it is clear that rather than thinking in terms of an ideal _observer_ or suitable _spectator_ (_shukan_), we should think in terms of ideal _embodied agents_ or appropriate _actors_ (_shutai_). When we think about ideal observers, we are left without a toehold by which to climb up to the ideal vantage point for observing the world. We search in vain for a formal explanation of the process of observation if we emphasize the subjective side of judgment or the formal properties of the object if we emphasize the objective side of judgment. In neither case, however, are we able to come up with a satisfying explanation for why those formal properties and no others are the correct ones for this subject and this object. Focusing instead of the subject as an agent suggests a method for overcoming these difficulties: placing judgment within the wider context of the way of life of the subject. Aesthetic experience is disinterested, but aesthetic judgments are rendered from within larger life projects.

Receptive experience, though important to understand, is just one part of the larger set of embodied activities undertaken by the subject. We not only stumble into beauty accidentally, but we actively seek it out as artists and as audiences. We prepare our minds to receive beauty by undertaking actions that open us to the possibility of disinterested enjoyment. The physical activity of walking to the theater or signing one’s name in the guestbook at the gallery should not be overlooked when analyzing the aesthetic experience, because these activities allow our bodies to help physically prepare the mindset of distancing and dissolution that will be needed. Even in a seemingly passive observer, the imagination races ahead and behind, painting the picture with the artist, singing the aria with the prima donna, composing the sonnet with the poet. Imaginative productivity accompanies any receptive aesthetic experience.

Because our ordinary experience is aspectival, the practical judgments we make about the world around us are already built it. We judge that the chair is for sitting and the body we see in the distance is a friend with whom we share a relationship. We see these things “as” having a certain in-order-to structure for us. Aesthetic experience, however, goes beyond the aspects given to us by the ordinary self to give new aspects to be seen “as if” from the perspective of the object. To be a “suitable spectator” for forming an aesthetic judgment therefore requires not only that we take up a certain cognitive stance, but that also that we engage in certain behaviors and activities that will both cultivate and demonstrate our suitability for going beyond the ordinary and practical.[^fn4-5] <!--Merleau-Ponty’s Cezanne’s doubt is interesting here, but maybe not germane enough∞ -->

[^fn4-5]: Space restrictions do not permit the elaboration of the parallel here, but attentive readers will note the similarity between this and Wittgenstein’s remarks concerning the importance of our “forms of life” to understanding one another. “If a lion could talk, we could not understand him” (*Philosophical Investigations*, 190). “What has to be accepted, the given, is---so one could say---_forms of life_” (192).

####Subject as plural
Thinking of the subject of aesthetic as _shutai_---actively embodied---rather than _shukan_---passively contemplating---leads us to another aspect of the subject. Human existence is a constant dialectical movement of double negation between the individual and social moments in our persistent relationships. Accordingly, it is misleading to think of the subject of aesthetic judgment as a purely individual. In the book _Milieu_,[^fn4-6] Watsuji explains that treating the mind and body non-dualistically as an embodied subject requires us to go beyond the study of individual persons to look at how persons come together to form communities. This is because,

[^fn4-6]: _Milieu_ is _Fūdo_ [風土][ja], 1935, WTZ 8:1--256. Geoffrey Bownas translated it into English under the title _Climate and Culture_. The position of this book within Watsuji’s career will be discussed at greater length in chapter five.

> The subjectivity of the physical body (_nikutai no shutai-sei_ [肉体の主体性][ja]) depends on the spatiotemporal structure of human existence as its ground. It follows that a subjective physical body is not an isolated physical body. The subjective physical body has a dynamic structure as though it were coming together even when isolated and isolating itself in its coming together. (WTZ 8:17)

To be a physical human being means to be constantly cleaving apart from others and cleaving together with others. While our individual subjectivities are an important aspect of aesthetic judgment, so too are our social subjectivities. To paint a full picture of aesthetic judgment, we must see how both are constructed. As was just explained, the basis of this construction is that we are actively embodied subjects in addition to being passively contemplating subjects. From the perspective of the passively contemplating subject, the problem of solipsism looms large, but the actively embodied subject dissolves the problem of solipsism just by writing about it. In writing, we engage with other human beings and so expand our cognition beyond ourselves. Language always extends beyond the individual through its roots in history.

In chapter two, I quoted from Watsuji’s _Study of Ethics_:

> It cannot be that the consciousness of the *I* who feels the beauty of a picture and the consciousness of Thou towards the same picture are completely independent things. We are feeling the same beauty together. The difference in the way that two people feel can only be compared on the ground of this shared feeling. (WTZ 10:76)

According to conventional philosophical anthropologies, my feelings are *mine* and therefore completely private. This leads to a crisis about how shared taste can even be possible. Watsuji’s anthropology, however, denies the presupposition that the individual self is atomic and substantive. As a result, we should not be surprised to see Watsuji arguing that “the interpenetration of the consciousnesses of self and other is especially prominent in its emotional aspect” (WTZ 10:74) because,

> In situations where the persistent relationship (_aidagara_ [間柄][ja]) of self and other is extremely intimate and the communal existence is acutely realized, the _I_ shares an identical emotion with the other. (WTZ 10:74)

Because the subject is not only individual but also communal, feelings can arise in the subject as communal and then be shared by subjects as individuals, and vice versa. In certain circumstances, these feelings are not just similar but the same. Watsuji gives the example of parents who lose a child. The sorrow they feel is not just similar, “the sorrow is for the parents a communal sorrow, thus they feel an *identical* sorrow together” (WTZ 10:74). Because the source of the sorrow is the shared in common, it is right to call it an identical emotion felt by two individual persons. The subject of this experience is the *we* who feel sorrow, not just the *I*.

Such sharing of intense feelings is what makes comparing aesthetic judgments and the subsequent creation of canons of taste in the art world possible. That such canons exist is an observable fact of everyday experience, but conventional anthropology makes them difficult to account for. If each individual is truly isolated, there is no sharing of feeling. If there is no sharing of feeling, how can there be agreement or disagreement? Disputation requires a common subject matter about which to dispute, hence there is no possibility of a judgment about felt experience unless feelings are somehow sharable.

On the other hand, everyday experience also shows us that very often aesthetic judgments fail to cohere. The saying *[de gustibus non disputandum est][la]* (“there’s no arguing taste”) is well established for a reason. The Watsujian anthropology being employed here is also well positioned to explain this phenomenon. Double negation requires a moment of individuation as well as a communal moment. We create our self-identities by both concurring with the group and dissenting from it. Initially, I take my background of tastes from those around me. I then make judgments that negate some of those tastes in order to create a unique self-identity. Finally, the separation of the individual from the group must be resolved through the change of my judgment or the group’s taste if a new union is to be established and the cycle to continue. By dissenting from the group, we create the possibility of creative evolution in our shared taste. On the other hand, there must be a moment when we come back to the group if what is established is to go beyond an idiosyncratic preference. Only when both aspects of judgment exist together is there a productive synthesis of communal taste.

One clear illustration of the process by which communities of aesthetic taste emerge is *gustatory* taste. Watsuji writes,

> we *divide* food to taste it. The taste is on the tongue of each person. But can those tastes be *separate tastes*? In the case of dividing and tasting some sugar, do we not taste *an identical sweetness*? Should one person feel the sugar to be bitter, we will immediately treat that person as sick. That is, we will handle it as a case of one being temporarily deprived of the ability to taste an identical sweetness. […] If bodily sensation were something that separated people from each other, such things could not be. (WTZ 10:80)

In the aesthetic experience of tasting delicious food, for instance, one nearly loses oneself in rapture to the flavorful sensation of the dish. However, this experience of partial self-dissolution is always made possible first by specific cultural structures. In *Milieu*, Watsuji puts the issue so:

> It is not the case that human beings first desired either livestock or fish and then chose either stock farming or fishing. Rather, we came to desire either livestock or fish on the basis of stock farming or fishing being climatologically (_fūdo-teki_ [風土的][ja]) determined. In the same way, the determinant of vegetarianism or carnivorism also is not ideology, as it is seen by the vegetarians, but our milieu (_fūdo_ [風土][ja]). So, our appetites are not aimed at something like food in general but are directed towards food created already in the manner of a specific cuisine that has been prepared since long ago. What we desire when we are hungry is bread or rice, beefsteak or sashimi, and so on. A form of cuisine expresses a people’s longstanding climatological self-apprehension. (WTZ 8:13)[^fn4-7]

[^fn4-7]: For a contemporary inquiry into the co-creation of desire and agriculture, see Michael Pollan, *The Botany of Desire*.

Before we can experience a meeting of subject-object, there must be a coming together of individuals as a collective subject in a society. The food we eat is an instance of American food or French cuisine or Szechuan cooking, etc. or some fusion thereof. We grow up eating certain foods and develop our tastes and desires within a certain culinary horizon, even as that horizon expands through our later experiences. Hence the subject of aesthetic experience can never be limited to the individual alone but must also include the communal whole. As Watsuji writes in _Study of Ethics_,

> The discrimination between approval and disapproval is itself from the first both individual and social, and it cannot be understood from outside the structure of human existence. (WTZ 10:135)

Hence when thinking of aesthetic judgment, the important contrast is not that between “objective” and “subjective” forms of judgment and taste but that between the judgments arising from the subject as individual and tastes arising from the subject as communal, both of which must exist in on-going double negation.

###What is an object?
Next, I will look more closely at the object of aesthetic judgment. In the last chapter, I suggested that an object is that which objects. Another way to look at the question of an object’s being is suggested by the grammar of Japanese. Watsuji notes that Japanese distinguishes sharply between the existential verb (subject _ga aru_ [がある][ja]) and the predicative copula (subject predicate _dearu_ [である][ja]).[^fn4-8] A. C. Graham explains in “ ‘Being’ in Western Philosophy Compared With *Shih/Fei* and *Yu/Wu* in Chinese Philosophy” that there has been a persistent tendency in Western philosophy to conflate the existential and predicative senses of “to be.” This tendency is not seen in Chinese or Japanese thought, and fallacies that rest on this equivocation are difficult to translate convincingly.

[^fn4-8]: Watsuji explains this in both _Study of Ethics_, WTZ 10:23f and “The Question of the Japanese Language and Philosophy,” WTZ 4:547ff.

The Sino-Japanese compound _sonzai_ [存在][ja], which also means “to exist,” is instructive as a contrast to the Western pair of *[essentia][la]* and *[existentia][la]*. _Sonzai_ is for the most part equivalent to _ga aru_ just as the English “to exist” is equivalent to “there is.” The value of _sonzai_ for Japanese philosophy is that because it cannot be used to say that “_A_ is _B_,” the grammar of the language makes it clear for a thing to exist is not the same as it having certain predicates. Watsuji asks rhetorically in _Study of Ethics_, “Can _sonzai_ be used as a copula or to show _[essentia][la]_? No, certainly not” (WTZ 10:23--4). Thus, the Japanese language resists the tendency towards essentialism and eternalism that is seen in some Western thinking. For a certain thing to “exist” need not require that the thing maintain certain properties. As with Watsuji’s theory of anthropology, existence can be a dynamic interplay of negation and double negation rather than the maintenance of a simple static essence.

Watsuji also looks at the word _sonzai_ in terms of its component characters [存][zh] (Jp. *son*, Ch. _cun_) and [在][zh] (Jp. _zai_, Ch. _zai_). In Chinese, where the compound was first used, _cun_ meant to preserve over time and _zai_ meant to be present in a particular place, hence as a compound the contemporary use of _sonzai_ continues to suggest temporal and spatial persistence (WTZ 10:24). Where the various Western terms for “being” suggest that to continue to exist is the default state of things, _sonzai_ suggests that objects may only temporarily attempt to resist their impermanence. An object exists in a certain place for a certain time in contradistinction to the background of the environment in which it arises. The object works to perpetuate itself while it can, but eventually it fails and is lost in the flux and flow of time.

On top of this, Watsuji further claims that our understanding of _sonzai_ must be in terms of _human_ existence, even when we speak of the existence of objects. For an object to exist is for it to exist in a certain place for a certain time, but if, as Watsuji argues (along with Kant and Heidegger), time and space are parts of the structure of human beings, then the existence of the object itself has to be understood in terms of its relation to the human subject: 

> If, as we said before, _son_ is the self-apprehension of the subject (_shutai_ [主体][ja]) and _zai_ is being within human relations, then “existence” (_sonzai_) is simply the self-apprehension of the subject as a persistent relationship (_aidagara_ [間柄][ja]).  We may moreover say simply that “existence” is “the linkage of conduct of humans” (_ningen no kōi-teki renkan_ [人間の行為的連関][ja]). Thus, in the strictest sense, existence is merely “human existence.” The existence of a thing is no more than an anthropomorphic way of speaking about “the being of a thing” (_mono no yū_ [物の有][ja]) that springs from human existence. (WTZ 10:25)

How is the being of a thing connected to human existence? In “The Question of the Japanese Language and Philosophy,”[^fn4-9] Watsuji looks at the existential _ga aru_ and the predicate _dearu_ and finds both of them rooted in human subjectivity as an active embodied presence in the world. Like other existential thinkers, Watsuji gives precedence to the existential rather than essential dimension of being, but unlike many Western existentialists, Watsuji grants that the precedence of existence extends to objects as well as human beings. At the most basic level, we encounter objects then define them as predicates by negating or limiting them. Hence, the qualities with which we predicate the objects are secondary to the more primary existence of those objects in experience:

[^fn4-9]: “The Question of the Japanese Language and Philosophy” is _Nihongo to Tetsugaku no Mondai_ [日本語と哲学の問題][ja], WTZ 4:506--51, part of _Study of the History of the Japanese Spirit, Continued_, _Zoku Nihon Seishin-Shi Kenkyū_ [続日本精神史研究][ja] (1935).

> in general “there is something” (_mono ga aru_ [ものがある][ja]) may be said to mean a human being possesses (_motsu_ [有つ][ja]) it. If this is so, it is because the way that a human being possesses it has been limited that _ga aru_ becomes _dearu_ through limitation. In the case of our saying, “There is a potted tree in the garden; it is a beautiful tree,” it is a form of limitation in which words show that a human being possesses the potted tree and its being possessed beautifully. That is, it is possessed in a way that is cherishing and admiring. Seen in this way, both _ga aru_ and _dearu_ belong to human existence, and _de aru_ becomes an expression of the way of that existence (*sonzai*) is limited. (WTZ 4:549)

This provides a vital clue to the nature of objects as possessed by us but separated from us through negation. The basic level of being for a thing is wrapped up in our world of practical concern. Some things are available to us as possible possessions and other things are unavailable. Those possibilities that obtain are said to be or to exist, but possibilities that cannot be realized are said not to be.[^fn4-10] Michael Marra comments on Watsuji’s essay in his own article, “On Japanese Things and Words,” and summarizes Watsuji’s theory so:

[^fn4-10]: A similar explanation can be made out of the modern standard Mandarin *you* [有][zh], “to exist.” The earliest forms of the character [有][zh] depict a hand holding meat, and the connection between existence and human possession has been maintained in latter usages.

> In other words, Being cannot stand aside from the particular entity and from the sphere of human action. Existence unfolds as Being […], and this unfolding takes place on its own (*ari no mama*), without the intervention of any thought. [The Thing], then, is the Being of the possibility of unfolding. (561)

&nbsp;

Watsuji’s _Milieu_ provides another vivid illustration of the way that the objects of our judgments are embodied and shared. Think of standing outside in the cold with an acquaintance. What will you say? Almost certainly, “Whew, sure is cold, huh?” Is the cold that you are feeling the _same_ as the cold that your acquaintance feels when you say this? Modern Western philosophers tended to treat the feeling of heat or coolness in objects as a secondary quality rather than a primary quality, which means that you are _not_ feeling the same cold as another.[^fn4-11] You feel only your own cold in your own mind, and on the basis of this feeling infer that a similar feeling may exist within the mind of your acquaintance. However, since you have never been your acquaintance, it is not clear how well rationally grounded this inferential process could be.

[^fn4-11]: Whitehead’s sarcastic rebuttal to the doctrine of secondary qualities in _Science and the Modern World_ is close to definitive: “The poets are entirely mistaken. They should address their lyrics to themselves, and should turn them into odes of self-congratulation on the excellency of the human mind. Nature is a dull affair, soundless, scentless, colorless; merely the hurrying of material, endlessly, meaninglessly” (54). Everyday experience so throughly refutes this colorless view of nature that the doctrine of secondary qualities must either be somehow flawed or our everyday experience has no purchase on the world as it is.

Watsuji sidesteps this difficulty by affirming what common sense tells us, namely that the cold I feel is the same cold that you feel:

> just as there is no obstacle to our saying, “*we* feel the cold,” it is we who bodily experience the cold and not just the *I*. *We feel the cold communally*. It is just because of this that we use a word that expresses this cold with one another as *an everyday greeting*. Even if amongst us the way of feeling of cold is different from person to person, this is possible on the ground of feeling the cold communally. Without this ground, knowledge of the bodily experience of cold in another *I* would be utterly impossible. (WTZ 8:10)

The basis of Watsuji’s conclusion here is that,

> An intentional object is not some kind of psychological content. It follows that coldness as the bodily experience of an independently existing objective cold air could not be the intentional object. When we *feel* the cold, we do not feel the “sensation” of cold, rather we directly *feel* the chill of the outside air, that is, the cold air. In other words, cold as “the thing felt” in intentional bodily experience is not “something subjective” (_shukan-teki na mono_ [主観的なもの][ja]) but “something objective.” Therefore, we may say that the intentional “relation” in itself of *feeling* the cold is already related to the chilliness of the outside air. (WTZ 8:9)

Looking for the cold within the subject as observer (*shukan*) is a hopeless task. Such a cold is a private object inside of us individually, but the cold that we feel is an object we feel ourselves inside of that we share with others. We locate the object of our feeling cold outside of us:

> When the cold is first discovered, we ourselves are already out in the cold. Therefore, that which is most primordially “being outside” is not a thing or object like the cold air, but we ourselves. “Going outside” is a fundamental prescript of our own structure, and intentionality as well is founded on nothing else. (WTZ 8:10)

Following Heidegger, Watsuji calls this state of existence in the world as a form of standing outside of oneself “[ex-sistere][la].” This going outside of oneself is the basis of space and time, which are parts of the structure of human existence. Hence when we see an object in the world, we are at once seeing something foreign to ourselves---an object that is objecting---but also something that is a part of us. The object exists in a space at a time, and that space and time are part of the shared structure of the human subject. To discover the object is to discover the _I_ opposed to the object and to discover the _we_ who gather around the object. 

An extended quote from _Study of Ethics_ is illustrative of Watsuji’s point:

> For example, when we *love* or *think fondly of* a row of ginkgo trees, we are treating the row of trees as a *Thou*. It follows that it is not the case that we first find ourselves surrounded by simple “things” and then infer the subsistence of a special species among those things, that is, one with another *I*, and then finally reach the phase of loving the trees by applying an analogy from my relation to the other *I* to my relation to the trees. When we find the trees, they are already trees with a character given by the ground of human existence, for instance as a row of ginkgo trees. The *we* who finds the row of trees is the *we* who already socially created things like rows of trees and not a *we* that must find these things inferentially. Whatever sort of a thing it is we find, we have already found that object before as a *Thou*. In this sense, the spatiality of the subject (*shutai*) acts as the means of finding objective things. In other words, generally speaking, the first moment in the establishment of an object is when a subject becomes a *Thou* or a *He/She* and opposes the *I*. (WTZ 10:188)

Our aesthetic appreciation of even natural objects like trees is mediated through the conceptual apparatus we possess as human beings in a community, and it is out of our communal humanity that these things emerge as potential objects of appreciation. They are extensions of our being as active subjects (*shutai*), not mere observers (*shukan*).

If this is the case, can Watsuji be said to be a realist about the object? Is his object just an idealist’s figment of the imagination? Is Watsuji’s account of existence so anthropocentric that it drains the outside world of its reality? I will argue that neither realist nor idealism properly characterizes Watsujian objects as I am describing them here. Instead he plots a Buddhist “Middle Way” between the two views.

In “I Touch What I Saw,” Arindam Chakrabarti provides four tests for whether one is a realist about an apple:

> (A) The apple is distinct from just an experience or idea of an apple.<br />
> (B)  The apple is distinct from just its red-color, its coldish touch, smooth texture and sweet taste, and also from just a series or set of these qualities. <br />
> \(C)  The apple that I now touch (or bite or smell) is the same as the apple that I saw a while ago. <br />
> (D)  The apple that I see is the same as the apple that you see. (105--6)

On the one hand, these tests can be answered by Watsuji in a realist fashion. (A) must be true if Watsuji’s phenomenological account of ex-sistere is correct.  An apple is distinct from the experience of an apple, because the apple is a thing outside of the mind that is intended in the experience of the apple. (B) must be true if the distinction between the predicative and existential uses of “being” is correct. For X to be an apple is not the same as saying that an apple is, so the apple is more than just a collection of predicates. \(C) follows from the _son_ aspect of _sonzai_: existence is a preservation against loss spread out over time. As for (D), it follows directly from our discussion of the subject as plural. You and I share a world, and on occasion we even share communal feelings. Of course, we may also share identical objects.

On the other hand, the tests can also be answered by Watsuji in an idealist fashion. Is the apple of test (A) “distinct” from experience? While the apple is an intentional object beyond the subject, it emerges as an object out of experience, so the distinction between the object and experience of the object is not sharp. By the same token, the distinction made in test (B) between the apple and its qualities is subjectively imposed rather than inherent. A recurring tendency in Japanese thought is the finding of essences within, not beyond, the phenomenal qualities of experience. (Recall the example of _yūgen_ [幽玄][ja], the “mysterious profundity” aimed at in Noh theater.) The constant flux of the world prevents the apple I touch now in test \(C) from being the exact same apple I saw before. Finally, the apple that you and I experience in test (D) are causally linked, but to the extent that I define myself in negation from you, my apple is not yours.

The solution to this impasse between realism and idealism is a Buddhist “Middle Way” that affirms the existence of objects on the conventional level while denying their substantiality on the ultimate level. On the one hand, objects are always empty because causally constructed and non-substantive. On the other hand, because objects are reducible in both top-down and bottom-up directions, neither reduction is complete, hence objects are just as real a concretion of suchness in a particular place and time as the subjects experiencing them.  

Returning then to the question of aesthetics, what is the object of aesthetic judgment? The object emerges from the active, plural subject understood as the space of persistent relationships, but it also stands outside of the subject drawing the subject away from itself. It is a particularity beyond the self that allows the self to find itself in new environs. There is a delicate interplay at work. Should the subject stay where it is and refuse ex-sistere, there can be no object, but on the other hand, should the subject expand too far, it will swallow the object up and there will be no ex-sistere because the self has merely come into itself. Accordingly, I wish to emphasize the dynamic, dialectical nature of the movement of double negation. As the term _sonzai_ implies, the subject-object complex has its existence as a temporary swelling in an ocean of impermanence. For a moment these waves roil through a field of relations, but always with the danger that a wave that grows too large becomes nothing more than the surface of the sea. What connects subjects and objects is that both spring from and return to emptiness itself.

###Normativity in aesthetic judgment and taste
Having reconsidered the nature of the subject and object of aesthetics, it is time to dig into the roots of the very possibility of aesthetic normativity. What makes aesthetic judgment possible? Why should the taste of the collective be binding for the individual? Why do individuals feel an urge to share their judgments with others?

Watsuji argues in _Study of Ethics_ that although there is regional variation in morality---for example, one society may approve of human sacrifice while another condemns it---this does not undermine the universality of the basis of ethics. In all societies what is condemned are actions that undermine the trust basis of that society and what is praised are actions that reinforce the trust basis of that society. In this section I will make a parallel argument, namely that aesthetic normativity has similar relative and universal aspects. Aesthetic taste varies markedly from culture to culture, yet in all cultures what it valorizes are those relationships between subject and objects in which the harmonization of elements allows for the growth of a new and greater fullness.

####Conscience and the internality of normativity
I will begin by looking at a parallel phenomenon of felt normativity: the feeling of ethical conscience. Just as in an aesthetic judgment we may feel that an object is “just right” or “all wrong,” in ethical conscience we may reflect on our own actions and instinctively feel them to be right or wrong. Of course, just as our conscience is not always correct in its assessment of the morality of an act, our aesthetic sensibilities do not always render correct aesthetic judgments. (Hence we must work diligently to cultivate our moral character in order to be ethical exemplars and cultivate our taste to be true connoisseurs. Interestingly, in the case of both conscience and aesthetic experience, it seems that insensitivity rather than hypersensitivity is the more common pitfall.) Yet in spite of its fallibility in particular cases, conscience and our moral intuitions are still the touchstone of any ethical investigation. All ethical theories must begin with certain fixed judgments of conscience, yet hope to rationalize and extend those judgments to new and less clear areas. In the same way, aesthetic experience must be the touchstone of any theory of aesthetic normativity. 

How is it that we as individual members of society feel the call of conscience? If values are being imposed on us from without in order to preserve the fabric of society, then it is not clear why as individuals we should feel an *inner* impulse towards a morality made to preserve *outer* order. In that case, the moral law is given to us heteronomously rather than emerging autonomously. Moral education would be a kind of deformation of the person by which the individual is trained to ignore her authentic desires and interests and to produce within herself a feeling of subordination to the order outside of her. Could it be that our call of conscience is really the result of a super-ego that is essentially alien to us? Watsuji argues no. In the determination of guilt by a court of law, the one who accuses me stands in for society as whole, but in an affliction of conscience, the one who accuses me is the very emptiness at the heart of my self. In spite of the great degree of social determination that undoubtably goes into the formation of conscience, when we truly feel the call of conscience it does not feel to us as something coming from without but it feels as though it was coming from our inmost personality. 

The reason for this should already be clear from our reexamination of the subject. The subject is a product of the negation of the emptiness that stands prior to the individual or the community. As such, the call of conscience does not arise as an external voice speaking for society but as an internal voice speaking for the authentic source of the subject. Our persistent relationships (*aidagara* [間柄][ja]) are the root of our authenticity (*honraisei* [本来性][ja]). The moral law at work in conscience is created by the same process by which we create ourselves. Being authentic means allowing that original root of our betweenness with others to develop itself in the direction of flourishing. Watsuji is at heart an existentialist ethicist, but unlike the other existentialists, he argues that authenticity comes from a harmonious, virtuosic relationship with others, rather than from an insistence on the freedom and substantiality of the individual.[^fn4-12]

[^fn4-12]: For what it’s worth, even in traditional existential ethics, the substantiality of the individual tends to dissolve in the face of some great whole, such as God in Christian existentialism or Nothingness/the Absurd for atheistic existentialism (cf. WTZ 10:85). Watsuji’s innovation is to see that if we insist on the vertical permeability of the self, there is no equally good reason not to allow for the horizontal permeability of the self.

Watsuji explicitly links his discussion of conscience to Mencius (WTZ 10:318), who coined the phrase [良心][zh] (Ch. _liangxin_, Jp. _ryōshin_, in _Mencius_ 6A.8) that eventually evolved into the term used to translate the Western concept of “conscience.” For Mencius, a well functioning ([良][zh]) heart-mind ([心][zh]) is one in which the capacity for moral development is not cut short but carefully cultivated. Such a heart-mind has the inclinations appropriate to the situation and acts on them. In the Warring States period, there was a debate about whether moral appropriateness (_yi_ [義][zh]) was _nei_ [內][zh] (roughly speaking, “internal”) or _wai_ [外][zh] (“external”), part of which is preserved in _Mencius_ 6A. There have been various interpretations of the exact meaning of this distinction, but we may on a loose reading take it that they wanted to know whether morality is in some ways dependent on the dispositions of the individual or if moral normativity can be imposed on the individual from without by completely impersonal formal considerations.[^fn4-13] For his part, Mencius claims that our sense of the appropriate must be _nei_ even as it responds to conditions in the world. I argue that what Mencius means by this is not that morality is “subjective” in the sense of being determined only by the individual, but that morality is _nei_ in the sense that it originates in our most inner and authentic self even as it is importantly interpenetrated by our relationships with others---in other words, it is subjective in the sense of a _shutai_ [主体][ja] that I have been exploring here.

[^fn4-13]: Kwong-Loi Shun, _Mencius and Early Chinese Thought_, 94--112 is a good starting point for this and other debates surrounding the interpretation of the _Mencius_. Shun defends an interpretation “which takes the internality of _yi_ [[義][zh]] to be the claim that one’s recognition of what is _yi_ derives from certain features of the heart/mind” (103--4).

Mencius and his interlocutors agree that one can take  gustatory taste---savoring a roast or wanting a drink of water---as paradigmatic example of _nei_ (_Mencius_ 6A.4 and 6A.5). Mencius points out that these tastes, while paradigmatically internal, are nevertheless respondent to external conditions. One of Mencius’ disciples asks rhetorically, “If on a winter day I drink hot water and on a summer day I drink cold water, then must my appetite and thirst also lie outside (_wai_)?”[^fn4-14] Clearly the answer is no. My wanting a particular kind of drink on the basis of external circumstances is not the result of some coercive education in inauthenticity, and does not make my desire to drink any less subjective (in the sense of *shutai* [主体][ja]) and internal. As quoted above from Watsuji’s _Milieu_, our tastes are communal and shared although also intimately subjective; my desire for meat is culturally constructed but also personally felt. It is a product of the subject as both communal and individual. If our hungers were not authentic---if the desire for food is not _nei_---then there are no authentic desires to be had. In the same way, argues Mencius, our sense of what is appropriate must respond to external circumstances (and should it fail to respond it would be an error, just as it is an error to desire salt water in a desert), but it nevertheless the internality of the sense of appropriateness that gives it jurisdiction with which to compel us.

[^fn4-14]: My translation of _Mencius_ 6A.5, “[冬日則飲湯，夏日則飲水，然則飲食亦在外也？][zh]”

In Watsuji’s language, we may state this same idea somewhat differently. Legitimate compulsion of the individual can only arise from the source of the individual, that is, from the subject, but the subjective origin of this compulsion does not mean that it is only a matter of what one particular person feels, since the subject is not only individual. In our everyday experience, it is possible for social structures seemingly outside of the individual such as the family, community, or state to compel the individual, but this does not mean that they can exercise their authority insofar as they are external. They have authority only insofar as they are constitutive of one as a person. Watsuji explains in the *Study of Ethics*, 

> A family or a state is something able as a human ethical totality to demand obedience of individuals, but it is not from the standpoint of the family or state alone that this demand has the right to claim obedience. (WTZ 10:130) 

If it is not as human ethical totalities that these institutions speak authoritatively, on whose behalf are they speaking? A human-ethical totality has the authority to compel an individual just to the degree that it authentically speaks for the betweenness out of which both it and the individual arise. That is, the individual and the totality must be woven together in a fabric of trust. Because the source of the individual and the social whole is the same, the one is on occasion able to speak for the other as the voice of its autonomous subject. This means both that the state is able to compel the citizen to follow its just laws and that the citizen is able compel the state to reform its unjust laws. The basis for both forms of compulsion is the mutual dependence of the two: the individual could not be who she is without her state, and the state could not exist without its individuals. At its best, the relationship of the citizen and the state is one of virtuosic mutual contribution and constitution. 


####Fashion and the cultural construction of aesthetic normativity
Next, I wish to apply this understanding of the subjectivity of conscience to an example of a subjective aesthetic sensibility that nevertheless responds to external conditions: our fashion sense. In all known human societies there have been some modes of body adornment considered appropriate and some considered inappropriate. One may choose to wear a uniform or not, but no one living in a society can drop out of the fashion race (though many have tried). Whether one chooses to wear what is considered socially appropriate, chooses to rebel against it, or even chooses not to reflect much on fashion at all; in any event one is intimately wrapped up in fashion. Fashion is closely tied to our self-identities, and in particular it is closely tied to the cultural construction of gender and class differences. Written and especially *unwritten* sumptuary laws dictate the fashion choices and the internal fashion sensibilities of individuals. Fashion is, therefore, a prototypical illustration of what Watsuji calls “the linkages of conduct” (_kōi-teki renkan_ [行為的連関][ja]). Through particular acts of fashion judgment by individuals, a culture-wide norm of fashion taste is created.

But if the fashion choices I make are imposed on me from outside---and they certainly are, otherwise it would not just so happen that men in the West wear shirts and pants, whereas men in other cultures have worn robes, etc., etc.---then why do I feel as though when I dress I put on clothes that reflect _my_ taste in clothing? Has the outside force of fashion education deformed my internal, authentic sartorial feelings? Has my individual, “subjective” fashion sensibility been trampled by the collective, “objective” tastes of my society?

Watsuji argues to the contrary that our fashion sense is an everyday experience of a kind of communal consciousness:

> The phenomenon of “fashion” shows this kind of communal consciousness in a particularly magnified form. It appears as a further narrowed _common taste_ within forms of food, clothing, and shelter already specified nationally and historically. Even if particular individuals had not been conscious of them as their own authentic tastes at the start, they feel this common taste as their own taste. And then something that departs from this taste is felt to be maybe funny or perhaps ugly. (WTZ 10:79)

In other words, in fashion our aesthetic norms originate outside of the particular individual, but they are nevertheless felt as the subjective tastes of individuals because those individuals are ultimately expressions through negation of the prior betweenness. Society may help shape my taste in fashion, but it is still _my_ taste. At the same time, however, by changing my aesthetic judgments about fashion, it is possible for me to change society’s taste in fashion. Personal aesthetic judgments and communally held tastes are mutually entailing and are ultimately expressions of the ways in which I as individual am made in part by the fashion of my society and my society is made in part by me. Neither individual nor collective fashion sense can exist in the complete absence of the other, hence both are empty of substantive existence. They are a mutually co-arising norm of conduct reflecting the twofold character of subject as individual and communal.

Hence there is a voice able to speak with authority about the kinds of taste experiences we “should” be having when we enter into an aesthetic experience. It is the voice of the society as it expresses itself as the source of the individual. Because this voice is trans-personal, it is possible for us as members of a community to discuss our tastes productively. It is not entirely “subjective” in the sense of being entirely individual-relative. On the other hand, since the voice is also the voice of the inmost source of the individual, this voice is “subjective” in the sense of being a part of the subject and able to, at times, command the assent of the subject. These properties of the voice of aesthetic experience help explain why Kant felt that aesthetic judgment is universal but subjective---aesthetic judgment has a normativity that originates within the individual but extends beyond it---without thereby committing us to an implausibly universal coherence of tastes. The scope of normativity for an aesthetic judgment or taste is only as wide as the subject itself. It extends toward anyone with whom I can have an interactive dialogue but it is not yet already extended towards “any rational being” in the absence of prior lived engagement with such beings. I share my tastes with those around me in society because those who are around me in society are a part of my subject, and I am a part of theirs. Together we render sentiments of taste normative as an expression of our interactions. I owe deference to the tastes of my culture, because without my culture I would not have been able to develop the tastes I have. My culture owes deference to my tastes, because I make up a part of my culture. These two obligations work in double negation to evolve new norms of judgment dialectically.

####Forming aesthetic judgments
We have seen that the mutual emergence of the subject and object of judgment from emptiness is the basis of normativity in aesthetics, but the actual process of concretely rendering a judgment remains to be brought into sharper focus. Aesthetic experience is direct and immediate, but aesthetic judgment is reflective and shared. Instead of simply letting the experience stand on its own, we attempt to reduce it into a form that is communicable to others. As a result, aesthetic judgment can never fully capture the richness of experience. Furthermore, because it is communicated, aesthetic judgment requires the backdrop of an established aesthetic taste against which to make its distinctions. At the same time, however, taste is something that emerges out of the consensus of previous aesthetic judgments. Aesthetic judgment and taste are mutually dependent and must co-arise within the interactions of an agentive, plural subject. Only by understanding human existence as the movement in which the individual and communal moments are double negated can we explain this co-arising. Aesthetic judgment is a form of individual limitation that shapes and is shaped by the aesthetic community in which it is given.

In the last chapter, I introduced this quotation from Watsuji’s unfinished notes on art theory:

> In this sense, the aesthetic appreciator can be said to be an appreciator who “contemplates the fullness (German, *[Fülle][de]*) of the object without interest (German, *[uninteressiert][de]*)” as Moritz Geiger says. (WTZ B1:145)

The notion of the “fullness” of the object needs to be explored in further depth. How can we judge the fullness of an object? The object just as much as the subject emerges from emptiness to exist for a short time. As the word _sonzai_ [存在][ja] implies, this existence is a struggle against impermanence rooted in space and time. Therefore, the voice that speaks to me as the source of my being also has authority to speak to the object as the source of its being. Ethical good is the continual growth and development of the cycle of double negation between persons, and aesthetic good is the growth and development of a fullness between the subject and object in  distancing and dissolution. We are able to judge an aesthetic object as good insofar as it is able to participate in the development of such fullness.<!--Cf. Kant on purposiveness∞--> In the case of art objects, Watsuji mentions two recurring criteria for assessing fullness that are given by German theories of aesthetics: 

> *art works are made by human beings*. Hence the artist’s *[Wollen][de]* (German, “will”) and *[Können][de]* (“ability”) are in them. To the extent that artists are human beings, it could not be the case, whoever they are, that their *[Wollen][de]* and *[Können][de]* are so deep as to be absolutely beyond our grasp. (WTZ B1:153--4)

Positing [Wollen][de] and [Können][de] as the ground of fullness in art objects leads us towards a relatively straightforward method for forming an aesthetic judgment. As I see it, the method would roughly be as follows: Before beginning, one should have adopted an attitude of empathy towards the art and the artist allowing openness towards the work. Then on the basis of knowledge about the circumstances of the production of the work to be evaluated, one infers what sort of active spectator would be suitable to view the work in question according to the original intention (*[Wollen][de]*) of the artist beyond the basic requirement of an empathetic one. (For example, one may need familiarity with prior works in a field in order to understand a particular piece.) Second, one does what is necessary to become such a active spectator. (This may involve developing one’s senses, becoming familiar with a canon, engaging with many similar works, prompting oneself in a certain way, or, in extreme cases, changing one’s style of life or values, etc.) Third, one experiences the work from the vantage point of the suitable spectator and see what sort of aesthetic experiences can be produced on the basis of the work as an object. Fourth, one evaluates the execution of the artist (*[Können][de]*) according to how well the work was able to achieve the aims set beforehand. Finally, it may be necessary on the basis of what is revealed by the prior evaluation of the work to revise one’s view of suitable spectator for the work by returning to the first step, reevaluating the life of the artist, reengaging in the cultivation of suitability as spectator, and iteratively continuing the process of evaluation indefinitely in a hermeneutic circle. Hence the judgment, “this is beautiful,” can be taken to mean something like, “this will be seen as beautiful should one approach it in a manner prescribed by the work.” The fullness of an art object in this case consists of its ability to live up to the intentions that caused it to come into being.

Laying aside the various challenges that have been made to the notion of an artist’s intention, the basic difficulty with this approach, as Watsuji points out in the same set of notes, is that not all aesthetic experiences are had in relation to works of art. We also have aesthetic experiences of nature and natural objects. However, judging those experiences is difficult because nature lacks something as straightforward as an artist’s intention in light of which to evaluate it. Watsuji remarks, “towards nature any *[Einstellung][de]* (German, attitude) is permitted” (WTZ B1:154), hence settling on a suitable manner from which to approach the object (beyond the basic level of empathic openness) is significantly more complicated. This in turn complicates the identification and assessment of the fullness of the object. On the other hand, Watsuji remarks that “nature is an unfathomably infinite fountain. As our eyes deepen, so deepens nature” (WTZ B1:153). That is, the more refined our understanding of nature becomes, the more nature presents for us to understand. So long as we begin with an attitude of empathetic identification with nature, we are sure to find some path to follow to a higher understanding in our interactions with the environment. The more we attune ourselves to the beauty of nature, the more beauty there is to uncover. That natural objects possess fullness is prima facie evident. <!--Cf. Kant’s theory of the purposeless purposiveness of nature.∞--> Making an assessment is difficult, but since natural objects emerge from the same emptiness as manmade objects, there must be some ground on which to form appropriate judgments of them.

In _Study of Ethics_, Watsuji writes that, “The highest value is an absolute totality, and an ‘aspiration’ (an upward impulse or fervent wish) for it is ‘good’ (_zen_ [善][ja])” (WTZ 10:142).[^fn4-15] That is, in an ontological sense the highest *value* may be a totality, but ethical *goodness* comes about through striving for this highest value, not through its static possession. Indeed, Watsuji goes on to argue that ethical badness is only bad insofar it brings to a halt the cycle of double negation, whether this comes about through atomic individualization or through falling victim to the crowd (WTZ 10:143). Movement itself is the ultimate good which gives retrospective meaning to the discords experienced along the way. The importance of dynamism for goodness applies as much to natural objects as manmade. An object is aesthetically good if it is an ultimately harmonious expression of the movement that created it. In Japanese, this harmonious expression is called _wa_ [和][ja] (Ch. *he*).[^fn4-16] The interrelation of part and whole in a good aesthetic object crystalizes the suchness of the environment as a creative outpouring of emptiness. The dynamism of the thing finds a reverberating expression that gives meaning to the faults and failures that came before, and a note that would be ugly on its own becomes beautiful within a greater concord.

[^fn4-15]: “Aspiration” is English in the original, but Bernard Bernier speculates Watsuji uses it as “the English rendition of _[Nachhängen][de]_, a word used by Heidegger in the sense of ‘projection from inside toward’ something” (_National Communion_, 100, n. 10). On the other hand, compare _Book of Changes_, _Xici_ 5, “The unifying of *yin* and unifying of *yang* is called *dao* and the continuity thereof is good” ([一陰一陽之謂道，繼之者善也][zh]). Whether Watsuji had this particular passage in mind or not, this passage and others make clear that Watsuji’s ethical vision shares with _Book of Changes_ the worldview that goodness resides in the development of novelty, not the achievement of a particular final state.

[^fn4-16]: Whitehead writes in _Adventures of Ideas_, “the perfection of Beauty is defined as being the perfection of Harmony; and the perfection of Harmony is defined in terms of perfection of Subjective Form in detail and in final synthesis” (252--3). A full comparison to Whitehead cannot be made here, but this coincides with the core of my argument. The highest fullness arises when each element is arranged in a form that gives greater meaning and depth to the whole without thereby giving up its individuality as an element.

Emptiness allows objects to overflow any attempt to reductively capture them from a top-down or a bottom-up direction, and this is the source of their aesthetic value. The emptiness of objects allows us to approach them in two ways. Objects can, on the one hand, be a source of dissatisfaction because we attempt to fix them in place; however, conversely objects are able, on the other hand, to be a source of satisfaction, when we are able to approach them in such a way that we allow them to be what they will be. The ability to let things be depends on the psychic distancing phase of aesthetic experience; the ability to feel into objects as they are depends on intoxicated dissolution.

Aesthetic judgment is a process by which we assess the fullness of objects by taking our immediate aesthetic experiences and rendering them in a form that is communicable to others who may not share them. In the art world, we assess this fullness against the background of ongoing projects in particular historical milieux. In the natural world, we assess this fullness by becoming sensitive to the “motives” of the things themselves (though of course, the social construction of the subject plays an important role in how capable we are of mustering such sensitivity). We enter into the world of objects without either assimilating them to ourselves or entirely surrendering our own selves to them. Instead we ecstatically experience the fullness of things in the mode of ex-sistere by stepping out of ourselves and into the alien.

That having been said, this discussion of the mechanics of aesthetic judgment is still somewhat more abstract than one might like. However, more concrete specification of aesthetic judgment cannot be made in the absence of consideration of the context of the subject who will be making the judgment. In the language of Arthur Danto, we need to specify the “art world” that will be judging the object and the “aesthetic predicates” that are significant within that art world. A more detailed account of this process will be made in the next chapter; however, the importance of context to aesthetic judgment does not render it completely relative. Aesthetic judgment, whatever environmentally and historically specified form it takes, always involves an ecstatic assessment of the fullness of things through the structure of human existence. 

###Taste and judgment in Japanese art and literature
####Traditional Japanese art forms
Next, let us examine some specific examples against a specific cultural background in order to illustrate some of claims made in the preceding discussion of aesthetic judgment. In _Milieu_, Watsuji observes that the coming together of “vital energy” (Jp. _ki_ [気][ja], Ch. _chi_ [氣][zh], the hylozoistic, processual “stuff” making up the world in Chinese cosmology) is central to many of the traditional Japanese arts. In other words, aesthetic excellence requires a dynamic process in which the double negation that usually makes up the self takes a different, more ecstatic form. While I wish to contend that the coming together of vital energy is central to all forms of aesthetic judgment, not just those in the traditional arts of Japan, nevertheless, these arts provide a particularly vivid demonstration of the dynamic structure I have been arguing for.

One such example is the traditional Japanese garden. Unlike English gardens, which prize artificiality and symmetry, Japanese gardens strive for an asymmetry mimicking the spontaneity nature. Watsuji writes,

> It is unified not according to geometrical proportions but according to a balance of forces that appeals to emotions, as it were, in a coming together of vital energy (_ki ai_ [気合い][ja]).[^fn4-17]  In precisely the same way that “vital energy comes together” (_ki ga au_ [気が合う][ja]) between person and person (*hito to hito to no aida ni* [人と人との間に][ja]), the “vital energy” (*ki* [気][ja]) comes together between moss and stone or between stone and stone. One may see it as taking every effort to avoid a prescribed regularity in order to bring their “vital energy” together. (WTZ 8:190)

[^fn4-17]: _Ki ai_ is also a term used in martial arts meaning roughly focusing one’s fighting spirit.

The aesthetic judgment of a Japanese garden rests on the feeling that every element has a harmonious place within the totality of the effect. Each stone is placed is relation to every other stone, yet without imposing a rigidly geometrical concept of order, just as in a good human society each person has role that harmonizes with others without reducing them to uniformity. As Confucius says in _Analects_ 13.23 harmony, (_he_ [和][zh]) is preferable to mere uniformity (_tong_ [同][zh]). True fullness cannot be achieved without preserving the individual identity of the elements within the whole.

Traditional Japanese ink paintings (called *sumi-e* [墨絵][ja] or *suiboku* [水墨][ja] in Japanese) also favor asymmetry over symmetry, yet the tonality of the whole must be very delicately balanced to allow the elements to form a greater harmony:

> In the composition of such pictures, one finds nothing that can be called in any sense symmetry, and yet one feels a *balance* in it without the slightest fissure. The blank space with nothing painted in it balances off the dark shadow of the sparrow as a deep and wide space, and the power held by the sparrow echoes together with the power of the few dark bamboo leaves that stand out amidst the other lighter ones. In this way, the various things occupy necessary positions from which they cannot be moved. Through the relation of balance as the coming together of vital energy, we come to feel that even in a canvas like this in which the objects are just painted in the one corner there is a richness to the arrangement of things. (WTZ 8:191--2)

The rich feeling of the painting comes from the way that the viewer can imaginatively relive the creativity, spontaneity, and vital energy of the artist’s brush just by looking. The mind’s eye repaints the canvas and in so doing inhabits the mind of the artist who originally painted it. Each stroke is present and perfectly positioned, yet no simple, mechanical rule underlies their placement:

> it is clear just in a glance *just how good* this all is, but we are unable to prescribe any sort of basic rule for how good it is. It is merely grasped intuitively as “a coming together of vital energy” without even an inch of room to move. (WTZ 8:192)

&nbsp;

Examples of the coming together of vital energy in traditional Japanese arts may be further multiplied since as Watsuji writes, “this kind of characteristic can be found variously in Noh, tea ceremony, and Kabuki as arts in which the vital energy comes together” (WTZ 8:195). Let us focus more closely on these examples first. Why does Watsuji emphasize the importance of asymmetry to the coming together of vital energy? A naïve reading is that the blank spaces in one’s garden, painting, and so forth straightforwardly present us with “emptiness.” William Lafleur considers this interpretation in “Buddhist Emptiness in the Ethics and Aesthetics of Watsuji Tetsurō” and rejects it:

> we may not identify emptiness with some kind of non-being which has been reified and now has managed to be mirrored by and through blank spaces on an artist’s canvas. Such an interpretation would not only involve a facile mimeticism but would also involve a fundamental misunderstanding of the meaning of emptiness. For Watsuji’s point about the void on the canvas is not that it makes palpable and concrete something metaphysical called ‘non-being’ but that it operates to make possible a series of relationships and reciprocities. (247)

The more sophisticated view that Watsuji is trying to express is, according to Lafleur, about the dynamic relationality of emptiness:

> But then why does the art so conspicuously avoid and reject any representation through symmetry? The reason is, I think, that in Watsuji’s view co-dependence is dynamic and multiple rather than static and single. In formal symmetry the balance and reciprocity is limited to the single and exact counterpart of a line, angle, or whatever. The observer can always designate the formal counterpart. But in the notion of emptiness there is reciprocity between forms and entities which are in no way mirror-images of each other. The mutuality is total even between rocks and moss, what is vast and what is minuscule. This mutuality is also open-ended and multiple. Surely it is one for which the formalized and objectified balance achieved in ‘symmetry’ is inadequate. (248)

Hence, Lafleur argues, the real meaning of rejecting symmetry lies in the non-symmetric mutuality of relations with others.

A parent and child, for example, cannot come into being without one another, but the relationship between parent and child is not symmetrical, because parents and children play importantly different roles in their relationship. So too, black ink of a bamboo shoot in an ink painting harmonizes with the whitespace around it through their mutual co-arising---the bamboo would not be recognizable without a clear background and the background would be destroyed if the bamboo took up the whole canvas---yet the positions of the two cannot be mirrored, since each gains its dynamic existence against the potential for loss (_sonzai_ [存在][ja]) in a unique manner.

We previously saw Sakai’s criticism that Watsuji’s emptiness is “reductive” of the subject, but these examples show that the meaning of emptiness is just the opposite of reduction. Emptiness overflows in value, filling the canvas with activity, the garden with life, and the tea hut with feeling. Nevertheless, Sakai further charges that Watsuji’s concept of persistent relationships (_aidagara_ [間柄][ja]) is overly symmetrical:

> Assuming this predetermined harmony expressed by his concept of _aidagara_, one could easily understand why Watsuji defines the being-between of the human being as the transferential and mutual penetration of consciousnesses and as the symmetrical reciprocity of you and me. Of course, such a reciprocity cannot be attained in an ordinary situation, but the predetermined harmony of totality and the individual suggests the possibility of symmetrical reciprocity, pure sympathy, and eventually “communion” as the presence of national totality. (113--4)

This interpretation of Watsuji is not wholly without grounding. Watsuji does suggest the possibility of reciprocity, sympathy, and even national totality; however, it is a mistake to refer to this as a “predetermined harmony” rather than a dynamic and evolving harmony, and Watsuji’s notion of relationality is, we have seen, anything but symmetrical.[^fn4-18] Rather, he emphasized the ability of non-symmetrical relationships to nevertheless find a common ground in the coming together of vital energy.

[^fn4-18]: Graham Mayeda also criticizes Watsuji’s supposed symmetrically in _Time, Space, and Ethics_, 93--7. Frankly, I am unsure why Mayeda takes Watsuji’s concept of relationality to be symmetric, and I believe he crucially misreads Watsuji’s example of the relation between a writer and reader (WTZ 10:53--5). Watsuji’s emphasis is on co-arising out of an asymmetric relationship. A writer is not a reader, but a writer would not write without the potential for a reader (in the limiting case, his or her future self). A reader is not a writer, but a reader could not exist without a writer. Neither readers nor writers could exist without the institution of literacy, but the collective institution of literacy is composed of individually literate persons. Hence the relationship between writers, readers, and literacy is throughly asymmetric but mutually entailing. Reading this relationship as intended to be not just mutually limiting but *symmetrical* requires us to attribute an uncharitably gross error to Watsuji while ignoring his valorization of asymmetry elsewhere in his writings. Watsuji’s emphasis on the importance of temporal development, for example, cannot be understood unless we see time as asymmetrical with goodness located in the aspiration for futurity.

####Interconnection of subjects in linked verse
Japanese linked verse, called _renga_ [連歌][ja] or *renku* [連句][ja], is another excellent example of the role of the coming together of vital energy in forming aesthetic judgments and taste, one worthy of an extended examination. Linked verse is by its nature a collaborative process governed by the chances product of many imaginations rather than the singular vision of a lead poet. In it, each poet contributes a verse that connects to the verse immediately before it, but not necessarily in continuity with the poem before that. In this way, a group of poets would spend the evening creating an aesthetic performance in which the perspective of each poem shifts radically when read in juxtaposition with the poem after it rather than before it. 

R\. H. Blyth provides an example of linked verse in the first volume of his _Haiku_. It was composed in 1690 by Bashō ([芭蕉][ja], 1644--1694),[^fn4-19] Kyorai, Bonchō, and Shihō and recorded in *The Monkey’s Straw Coat* (_Saru Mino_ [猿蓑][ja], 1691). For brevity, I will excerpt only the first three verses of the thirty-six verse sequence:

[^fn4-19]: Bashō is now often referred to as a haiku poet (including by Blyth below), but readers should bear in mind that this designation is anachronistic. In Bashō’s time, the initial verse of a linked verse sequence was referred to as a *hokku* [発句][ja]. The term *haiku* [俳句][ja] was coined by Masaoka Shiki ([正岡 子規][ja], 1867--1902) to refer to *hokku* that exist independently from a linked verse sequence. While Bashō certainly wrote what we would now call haiku, to properly understand his career it is important to recall that he considered himself a master of *renga*, not merely isolated verse. Makoto Ueda comments in _Matsuo Bashō_, “It can be argued that he poured more energy into renku than into haiku” (70).

> [去来: 鳶の羽も刷ぬはつしぐれ][ja]<br /> > [芭蕉: 一ふき風の木の葉しづまる][ja]<br /> > [凡兆: 股引の朝からぬるゝ川こえて][ja]<br /> > <br />
> Kyorai: _Tobi no ha mo /kai-tsukuroinu / hatsu shigure_<br /> > Bashō: _Hito fuki kaze no / ki no ha shizumaru_<br /> > Bonchō: _Momo hike no / asa kara nururu / kawa koete_<br /> > <br />
> Kyorai: Its feathers / The kite has preened / In the first winter rain.<br />
> Bashō: A gust of wind blows the leaves; / They are quiet.<br />
> Bonchō: The breeches wet / From morning, / Crossing the river.[^fn4-20]

[^fn4-20]: Translation taken from Blyth, _Haiku_, 127.

Notice that the verses tell a story in pairs (Kyorai’s and Bashō’s; Bashō’s and Bonchō’s) but not all together. Put together, Kyorai’s verse and Bashō’s verse paint a coherent picture of the first winter rain drizzling down on soggy leaves that stir noiselessly. Bashō’s and Bonchō’s tell a story in which one’s breeches are wet from crossing the river on a gusty morning. In the second story, it cannot be raining or else one’s coat would be soaked as well, hence the second story actively contradicts the first.

As we see, linked verse vividly demonstrates the importance of context to the object. No verse by itself has a particular meaning. Rather, its meaning depends crucially on what comes before and after it. On the other hand, linked verse also shows the way that such contextually dependent objects can begin to possess a life of their own that we ecstatically inhabit. In spite of the kaleidoscopic recontextualization of the particular verses, over the course of the linked verse sequence as a whole, a unity pervades.  As Watsuji writes in _Milieu_, 

> In linked verse, each verse has its own independent world, and yet between them there is a subtle *connection*, so that one world expands into another, and it possesses an arrangement as a totality. (WTZ 8:194)

A whole set of linked verses shows the unity of authors as a collective subject while also showing their particular individuality; it shows the unity of the verses while also demonstrating a diversity of topics, seasons, and moods. Toward this end, numerous literary convention were employed in order to keep up the unity of the verse concerning permissible imagery, words, transitions, etc. Makoto Ueda explains in _Matsuo Bashō_,

> renku writing has its dangers, and the most obvious is that a poem will fall apart if the poets fail to unite their efforts. To safeguard against this hazard a number of rules have been laid down. […] These and many other rules of composition are imposed upon each renku poet, making his task not at all an easy one; he has to be an individual and part of a team at the same time. Too original a verse is not commendable since it does not fit well with the rest of the verses, while too conforming a verse makes the poem monotonous. (69--70)

Blyth further remarks:

> At all events, we have here a kind of communistic poetry, and in it we may see the poetic life being lived by four old Japanese poets, both individually and in communion. Part of its worth lies precisely where we cannot grasp it, in the overlapping, in the interpenetration of one scene with another, of man with nature. […] Every haiku […] has a kind of fluidity which is different from vagueness. This fluidity makes it less static, less circumscribed; we see things in their manifold relations, at the same time as we see them as solitary objects. (138)

This double vision of the co-arising suchness of persons and objects is precisely what has been posited in this chapter as the heart of aesthetics as double negation. How is this possible? Watsuji asks,

> And yet how is “randomness” able to create an artistic unity? Here as well the answer is the coming together of vital energy, albeit vital energy with personality. The excellent arrangement of linked verse cannot be had without the coming together of the vital energy of all the participants. While leaving their individual particularity intact, they bring their vital energy together in their creation and express the lived experience of each in the echoing reverberation of each other’s hearts. (WTZ 8:194)

The three verses given above are clearly telling two different stories, but unlike the Surrealist “exquisite corpse” parlor game, we do not get the sense of sheer nihilistic randomness from the careening shifts of the verses. It is the coming together of vital energy that draws the verses together. The aesthetic judgment of the participants clearly requires a certain frame of mind to unite them in spite of their differences, and that this frame of mind can exist at all reveals to us the twofold nature of the human subject as both individual and collective.

When the participants achieve the coming together of vital energy, a greater whole is created out of which aesthetic judgment comes to have a normative force. Because the human being is both individual and collective, a linked verse is able to show both the individual and collective aspects of the personality of its collaborators without having to eliminate one for the sake of the other. The structure of a linked verse meeting provides the authors with detachment from their ordinary concerns but their appreciation for their mutually crafted verses allows them to express their hearts openly in an “echoing reverberation” of merging perspectives.

####Linked verse and aesthetic authority
One incident in the life of Bashō illustrates the nature of authority in aesthetic judgment. Blyth relates a dispute that arose about the proper interpretation of a poem by Bashō’s disciple Kyorai. The poem is:

> [岩鼻やここにもひとり月の客][ja] <br/>
> <br/>
> _Iwa hana ya / koko nimo hitori / tsuki no kyaku_<br/>
> <br/>
> On the edge of this rock, / Here is one more / Moon-viewer. (343)

Blyth translates from _The Records of Kyorai_ (_Kyorai Shō_ [去来抄][ja], 1704):

> Kyorai said, “Shadō asserted that this must be a monkey, but what I intend is another person.” Bashō retorted, “A monkey! What does he mean? What were you thinking when you composed the poem?” Kyorai answered, “As I was walking over the fields and mountains, singing under the light of the full moon, I found, on the edge of a rock, another man filled with poetical excitement.” Bashō said, “In the phrase, ‘There is one more person,’ you announce yourself; in this there is poetry.” […] My poetical taste is below the highest, but in Bashō’s interpretation, there is something fantastic, I think. (343)

About this incident, Blyth remarks, “we have here the entertaining picture of Bashō telling Kyorai, not what he ought to have said, but what he ought to have meant by what he said” (343). Why is Bashō’s interpretation preferred over Kyorai’s? What is the source of his authority? Ought not Kyorai as the author of the poem have a deeper insight into its authentic meaning? As Kyorai’s master, Bashō is in a position to offer a more authoritative interpretation of Kyorai’s work. Through a lifetime of training, Bashō has made himself able to instantly size up the merits of a haiku. He is able to speak for the poetic betweenness in which they both operate. One of the reasons that it is Bashō and not someone else (for example, Shadō) who is in that position is that Kyorai as the author had always intended for the poem to be evaluated by someone with the degree of insight that he considered his master to have. Kyorai trusts Bashō’s taste. Thus, as an author, Kyorai has the authority in his intention to invest Bashō with a claim to the authoritative interpretation. Bashō may be called an “ideal observer” or “suitable spectator” for the poem because he has cultivated his taste to its utmost. But notice that the judgment that Bashō achieved came not through passive observation or spectating but through a lifetime of embodied engagement in the poetic arts. He traveled from town to town participating in poetry meetings until it killed him.[^fn4-21] Thus, it is better to describe Bashō as an “authoritative agent” rather than an “ideal observer.” The connoisseur must be in some sense an accomplished creator (even if only a creator of criticism) who enacts his or her artistry as an expression of the betweenness out of which the artistic community emerges.

[^fn4-21]: Famously, Bashō died while traveling. His final poem is [旅に病で夢は枯野をかけ廻る][ja], _tabi ni yande / yume wa kareno wo / kake-meguru_, “Sick on a journey / my dreams meander / in withered fields.”

Notice also Bashō’s interpretation of the poem: “In the phrase, ‘There is one more person,’ you announce yourself” (343). The experience of this verse also fits within the structure of _ri-ken no ken_ [離見の見][ja] or “the seeing of distant seeing.” “On the edge of this rock” introduces the scene with detachment or psychic distance. From a distance, the poet is observing a far off mountain peak. Then the poet writes, “There is one more.” If we remained in a detached perspective, this would merely introduce another object of contemplation. But as Bashō recognizes, the detached perspective must now gain greater depth through its reflexivity. If there is one more on the mountain, then I am on the mountain, too. This leads inexorably to the moment of aesthetic experience in which the difference between the poet’s self and the other on the peak are felt in a broader context through intoxicated dissolution. They are all moon-viewers: the poet, the other person, the even the edge of the rock. In the moment of the aesthetic judgment, the subject moves ecstatically to see the ordinary self as just another moon-viewer. The normative authority to speak for that subject is invested by the aesthetic community of taste in one who has cultivated the ability actively crystalize such moments.

####Poetic truth in linked verse
∞Needs more thesis: norms for this community grow out of their group taste

One of the central considerations in this debate and for any poet in that period of Japanese history was a poem’s connection to the _hon’i_ [本意][ja] or “root implications” of the situation versus merely private implications (_shii_ [私意][ja]). Kōji [Kawamoto][sc]  explains in _The Poetics of Japanese Verse_ that certain poetic images had, in the course of Japanese literary history, developed certain fixed associations. For example, the autumn dusk is forlorn. Kawamoto writes, 

>_Hon’i_ is usually explained as the essential qualities inherent in an object and the emotional response deemed appropriate. However, […] the actual qualities of the phenomenon itself were second to the conceptual qualities acquired through literary precedent. To give a twist to Oscar Wilde’s famous remark […], there may have been autumn dusks for centuries in Japan, but no one saw them until the age of the _Shinkokinshū_ (ca. 1210), when the theme of autumn evening began to attract markedly strong interest.[^fn4-22]

[^fn4-22]: Kawamoto, 61. Oscar Wilde’s famous remark is “There may have been fogs for centuries in London. I dare say there were. But no one saw them, and so we do not know anything about them. They did not exist till Art had invented them” (Kawamoto, 10 and Wilde, 41). For further discussion of this quotation, see chapter six.

It was against this tradition of writing about lonely autumn dusks that Bashō added his own poem:

> [この道や行く人なしに秋のくれ][ja]<br/>
> <br/>
> _Kono michi ya / yuku hito nashi ni / aki no kure_<br/>
> <br/>
> Autumn dusk / on this path /without a traveller.[^fn4-23]

[^fn4-23]: My translation here and below.

In this verse, Bashō is doing several things simultaneously. Concretely, he observes the lonesome emptiness of the road he walks. Abstractly, he complains that few follow the way or *dao* [道][zh] to which he has dedicated his life. Literarily, he connects himself into a long tradition of poetry about the lonesomeness of the evening in autumn. The overall effect of the verse comes from the interpenetration of these aspects in a single moment of time. 

Yosa Buson ([與謝 蕪村][ja], 1716--1783) further continued the poetic tradition of forlorn dusks but tweaks it a bit:

> [さびしさのうれしくもあり秋の暮れ][ja]<br />
> <br />
> *Sabishisa no / ureshiku mo ari / aki no kure*<br />
> <br />
> The loneliness of / the autumn dusk / also has its joys.

These examples illustrate an aesthetic community advancing into novel fullness through the individuating negations of its members. An individual proposes that a certain situation has a certain *hon’i* to it, and then this judgment is taken up and made a part of the taste of that community. Over the centuries, the root implications of a certain situation are thoroughly explored and refined through the continual interpenetration of personal experience and literary allusion. When Bashō emphasizes the loneliness of a situation a bit too strongly, Buson pipes up to remind us that there is joy also in loneliness.

For Bashō and other Japanese poets, the aim of poetry is the kind of naturalness that arises when things are able to express themselves as they are, including emotionally. The autumn evening will reveal its lonesomeness to us if we are open to it. Hattori Dohō ([服部 土芳][ja], 1657--1730), one of Bashō’s students, records one of his master’s teachings in _Sanzōshi_ [三冊子][ja]: 

> “Learn of the pine from the pine; learn of the bamboo from the bamboo.” These words of our Master mean to distance oneself from private implications (_shii_ [私意][ja]). Learning that leaves one as one is is not in the end learning. He says, “learn,” because what makes a verse is entering into things and feeling the delicate emotions that appear. For example, 
even if you put into words that something is, should there be no feeling coming from the thing itself naturally, the thing and the *I* will remain two, and sincere truth of feeling will not be achieved. It will be an idea constructed from one’s private implications.[^fn4-24] 

[^fn4-24]: My translation. Original in [Nose][sc] Asaji, *Sanzōshi hyōshaku*, 97--8. Cf. Kawamoto, 64.

In other words, when Bashō writes emotionally charged poems about the world, he takes it that these poems are not drawing from any private or individually subjective emotional associations with things in the world (_shii_), but from a proper understanding of the emotionality embedded in the world as a matrix of natural and social co-construction (_hon’i_). The _hon’i_ come from putting the self into the object and letting the object express its own feeling of fullness naturally. 

Another example of _hon’i_ of things comes from Bashō’s _The Narrow Path to the Interior_ (_Oku no Hosomichi_ [奥の細道][ja], 1702):

> [行春や鳥啼魚の目は泪][ja]<br/>
> <br/>
> _Yuku haru ya / tori naki uo no / me wa namida_<br/>
> <br/>
> Passing spring: / the birds cry and the fish / have eyes full of tears.

Formally speaking, the poem consists of two parts divided by the cutting word _ya_. In the first, the poet invokes the passing spring. Earlier Japanese poets had created an association between grief over the changing of the seasons and the crying of birds (Kawamoto, 84--5).  One source of this association is the poem “Spring Prospects” (_Chun Wang_ [春望][zh]) by Du Fu ([杜甫][zh], 712--770), which reads in part: 

> [國破山河在，城春草木深。感時花濺淚，恨別鳥驚心。][zh]<br />
> <br />
> The nation shattered, mountains and rivers remain;<br />
> city in spring, grass and trees burgeoning.<br />
> Feeling the times, blossoms draw tears;<br />
> hating separation, birds alarm the heart.[^fn4-25]

[^fn4-25]: Translation from Watson, _The Selected Poems of Du Fu_, 30. 

Here we can see the core elements that Bashō’s poem has refashioned to capture his experience: spring, tears, separation, and birds. The only missing element are the fish. In general, Bashō’s writing often skillfully refashioned ancient Chinese and Japanese sources to give them a personal twist.

In the second part of the poem, we are given a concrete image of spring’s passing that relies on this association. In Japanese, both the singing of birds and the mourning of humans are called _naki_ (crying), and Bashō has played up this ambiguity by writing _naki_ with the character [啼][ja], which can have either meaning, rather than using 泣, which specifically means mourning, or [鳴][ja], which specifically means birdsong. Within the narrative context of _The Narrow Path to the Interior_, we form a mental picture of Bashō as he and his disciple leave to begin their long journey. Bashō explains: “I set out after composing this verse, the first of my journey, but I could barely keeping going ahead, for when I looked back I saw my friends standing in a row, no doubt to watch until we were lost to sight.”[^fn4-26]

[^fn4-26]: Translation here is from Keene, _The Narrow Road to Oku_, 23.

Reading this, some critics might suggest that the concreteness of the poem’s imagery is undercut by Bashō’s strong emotional response. As Japanese literature critic Haruo Shirane notes in _Traces of Dreams_, the birds and fish seem to “mourn the passing of the spring, and by implication the departure of the traveler” (247). Yet, a critic might claim, this is surely impossible for birds and fish. Moreover, some commentators take the poem as perhaps representing travelers by the passing spring or allegorically identifying the disciples left behind with the fish and the departing Bashō and Sora with the birds (Shirane, 247). Other scholars interpret the image of the fish’s tears more literally by seeing them as beads of water on fish in a fishmonger’s shop (Kawamoto, 85). In any event, for Bashō to simply anthropomorphically project his own grief onto the world around him would be an instance of the pathetic fallacy and a betrayal of the ideals of _hon’i_. When we interpret Bashō’s poem from the perspective of the _hon’i_, we see that he is not projecting his own sorrow onto the birds and fish, but to the contrary, because of his immersion in his native poetic tradition, he is able to see the resonance between his individual grief and the larger grief that arises out of the situation itself. It was his own grief at leaving that provided a gateway for Bashō to step through and feel correctly the pathos inherent to the situation. The grief was already in the birds and fish, but it was only at that very moment that his own perspective allowed him to see their grief. Just as one can only see the beauty of the sunrise if some stimulus wakes one up early in the morning, in order to understand the passing of the spring, Bashō had to find himself in a context in which his grief acted as a stimulus that awoke him to the deeper grief of the passing of spring. His own grief is what awoke him, but what he saw once awake was something outside of himself: the fullness of the object as he and it arise from emptiness.

Kawamoto notes that _hon’i_ are difficult to categorize using traditional Western schemes of classification since they are neither clearly subjective nor clearly objective. Kawamoto explains that while _hon’i_ are in one sense merely connotative, nevertheless,

> it is not a subjective meaning dependent on each individual speaker or listener. Rather, as a conventional association, it has gained the objectivity and legitimacy of something normative. (4)

From the perspective of this chapter, we might say on the other hand that _hon’i_ are something subjective, but they are not “subjective” as individual impulses, but as the normative aesthetic judgments of a collectively embodied subjectivity that arises out of nothing and tries to position itself in such a way as to gain the authority to speak for the emptiness at the heart of things. Hence in the _Sanzōshi_, according to Kawamoto,

> Bashō is saying that poetic truth can only be achieved through a sympathetic and selfless faith in the traditions of the past. As the boundary between the one who sees and the object seen grows weak, the two are fused, and the division into subject and object becomes meaningless. (65)

_Hon’i_ are difficult to classify as objective or subjective exactly because of the brittleness of those categories as they have been traditionally understood. There is an aesthetic normativity to _hon’i_. _Hon’i_ are what one _should_ feel in a given situation. Indeed, the Japanese poets would insist that a fact about the autumn sunset was revealed when it came to be associated with a sense of forlornness, and a fact about the passing spring was revealed when they came to associate it with the calling birds. These associations are just as normative as the causal associations that force us to think of the second billiard ball rolling away when see the first about to impact it. In the case of Japanese literature, it is just that the object of association is emotional rather than physical. In spite of the emotionality and subjectivity of these associations, they are not merely idiosyncratic they are a way of entering into and showing the sincere truth of things.

At the same time, however, it should be clear that these associations are culturally constructed, and they acquire their normativity only insofar as we are willing to enter into membership of the aesthetic community by which they were created. There is no need to posit a universal normativity to these associations that extends to all rational beings. Rather, this normativity extends only to those who are willing and able to join in the aesthetic community as it increases its span in time and space.

###Conclusion
In this chapter, I have attempted a hermeneutic reconstruction of aesthetic judgment. The subject of aesthetics, we have seen, is not a passive observer of objects, but active and embodied. We live our aesthetics out among others. Moreover, the subject is not only individual but also collective. The commonality of aesthetic judgment rests on our ability to share our feelings with those to whom we are closest. The aesthetic object is neither the independent and aloof object of realist ontology nor the imaginary figment of idealist ontology. The object emerges from the same experiential flux of the subject, but it is placed outside of the subject and draws the subject away from itself.

Because subject and object emerge from a common source, it is possible for the subject to inhabit the fullness of the object and present judgments about this fullness for examination by others. In the same way, the tastes of the community are able to gain normative authority over the individual through their shared subjective origin. The key to aesthetic judgment is the coming together individual subjects to form a collective subject as preparation for the ecstatic appreciation of the object. In the case of art objects, the embodied subjects of the artist and the audience meet to form a community of taste. They establish norms and principles based on their mutual interaction and disinterested enjoyment of the object. The object as well, in art and nature, meets the subject and calls it out of itself into an ecstatic experience of the common ground between them. Judgment is rendered on the basis of the overall fullness felt when meeting with empathy.

The Japanese aesthetic tradition illustrates well the claims of this chapter. In many Japanese arts, the unifying principle is not a rational formula but the coming together of vital energy (_ki ai_ [気合い][ja]) of the artists and audience involved. Such a coming together cannot be understood apart from the lived experience of the participants. Linked verse in particular makes this quite evident. Poets in this tradition sought to capture the _hon’i_ [本意][ja] or “root implications” of the situations they related in verse. These root implication are neither simply individual associations nor “objective” representations of the situation. Instead, they are subjective sensitivities developed within a particular cultural history that enable one to realize the feelings inherent in the situation. The feeling is in the situation, but so is the feeler of the feeling. The subject and object of aesthetics must be distinguished to create an aesthetic judgment, but this distinction is always only temporary and conventional.

Having examined the nature of the subject and object of aesthetic judgment and taste, we must now attempt to describe not only subjectively felt aesthetic normativity but the objective expression and development of this felt normativity in the arts. Accordingly, in the next chapter we will look at the role of history and milieu as the context in which art develops.
