##Chapter 4. The Subject and Object of Aesthetic Judgment

####Contents:
<toc />

###From my feelings to our judgments
How do I form my aesthetic judgments as an individual, and how could I ever share my personal, internal, individual, “subjective” aesthetic judgments with any else? Why should I as an individual come to feel compelled in my aesthetic preferences by the preferences of others? What is the source aesthetic agreement? How is it that there are such things as communities of taste? How can deference to the preferences of others possibly be an authentic expression of my subjectivity? Is there anything like normativity in aesthetic judgment or can we only describe our own aesthetic feelings without prescribing them for others? Is aesthetic judgment universal, relative, or something else?

In the last chapter, we began our hermeneutic inquiry into aesthetics with an attempt to “restore” our understanding of aesthetic experience as it is felt in everyday experience, where the subject and object are not cleanly distinguished. This experience is one of dynamic distancing, dissolution, and disinterested enjoyment. On the basis of this experience, I, the subject, judge the object to be beautiful or ugly, lovely or disgusting, sublime or mundane. But what is it about aesthetic experience that creates a basis for judgment? To answer this and the questions given above we must in this chapter go beyond just the surface experience of aesthetics as _kansei_ [感性][ja] or sensibility and begin to move towards an understanding of aesthetics as _bigaku_ [美学][ja]---the study of beautiful things and our judgments about them. Because aesthetic judgment is a form of judgment, it can only be made within the context of a cleanly separated subject and object, and this calls for the second step in the hermeneutic methodology outlined in the second chapter, namely construction. We create a subject to look at the object from outside and evaluate it. Accordingly, in this chapter we will need to look more closely at the nature of subject and the nature of the object as they are co-constructed before we can satisfactorily explain the source of aesthetic judgment and our methods for carrying this judgment out. Finally, we will look at examples from traditional Japanese arts, particularly linked verse, that illustrate our contentions about the nature of the self and judgment.

###Who is the subject?
####Subject as agent
As mentioned previously, Naoki Sakai is critical of what he feels is Watsuji’s project of “reducing” the subject to a twofold structure of individual and community as _ningen_ [人間][ja]. While I feel that Sakai’s criticisms are somewhat wide of the mark, he does do a service for readers who are primarily familiar with Watsuji in translation by drawing attention to aspects of Watsuji’s philosophy that might otherwise be lost in translation. In *Translation and Subjectivity*, Sakai notes that the word “subject” has many renderings in Japanese:

> _Shutai_ [[主体][ja]] was introduced into Japanese intellectual vocabulary as a neologism, as one of the translations for “subject,” _sujet_, or _Subjekt_, other translations being _shugo_ [[主語][ja]] (propositional subject), _shukan_ [[主観][ja]] (epistemic subject), _shudai_ [[主題][ja]] (thematic subject), _shinmin_ [[臣民][ja]] (subject of the emperor), among others. (119)

While most of these ambiguities are fairly clear even to readers whose primary language is English (the subject of a sentence is plainly a different thing than the subject of a king), those who read Watsuji only in translation are apt to miss the distinction he makes between _shutai_ [主体][ja] and _shukan_ [主観][ja]. In both words, the _shu_ [主][ja] represents the host or ruler as opposed to a “guest” (_kyaku_ [客][ja] from which comes “objectivity,” _kyakkansei_ [客観性][ja]). <!--relativity of shu-kaku?∞-->The _kan_ of _shukan_ means to look or to observe, hence _shukan_ indicates the subject as one who passively receives sense data. The _tai_ of _shutai_, on the other hand, means a physical body or the unit of a larger whole.[^fn4-1] The suggestion of _shutai_ as opposed to _shukan_ is that of a body at work among other bodies instead of an isolated observer. _Shutai_ indicates the subject as embodied agent who is a practical and active. In _Climate and Culture_, Geoffrey Bownas sometimes translates _shutai_ as “self-active body” and other times as just “subject.” Sakai writes,

> The term “subject” or _shutai_ itself was thus posited as the central philosopheme around which topics related to praxis, on the one hand, and the determination of particular social relations, on the other, would be woven together in Watsuji’s study of the human being. (79)

When translating Western works on the nature of the subject into Japanese, those works which consider the subject to be ultimately a transcendental observer tend to be translated using _shukan_, but those under the influence from Marx, Nietzsche, and other sources in which the subject is as the agent of action are translated using _shutai_. [Nishida][sc] Kitarō’s theory of active intuition (*kōi-teki chokkan* [行為的直観][ja]) in particular was crucial in bringing out this aspect of the subject.[^fn4-2] For our purposes, the critical aspect of _shutai_ is that it shows the importance of the living body as the ground of the human being and the importance of active engagement as well as passive contemplation. 

[^fn4-1]: The character for _tai_ in _shutai_ was written as [體][zh] in the pre-war orthography, which reflects the close connection between the physical body and Confucian _li_ [禮][zh] (ritual propriety). In post-war Japanese orthography and mainland Chinese simplified characters, _tai_ was standardized as [体][zh], which had existed beforehand as a handwritten variant. This way of writing _tai_ is meant to show that the body is the root ([本][zh]) of the person ([人][zh]).

[^fn4-2]: Sakai p. 213 n.4 notes that the interest in _shutai_ by Watsuji and others can be traced to Nishida, especially _Nishida Kitarō Zenshū_ 6:341--427.

In _Study of Ethics_ Watsuji makes it clear that seeing the subject as “ ‘one who observes objects,’ that is, the _shukan_” leads to philosophical difficulties in ethics because “the problem of human existence, the problem of linkages of conduct and practice have no connection to the aforementioned isolated _shukan_” (WTZ 10:11). That is, the most central philosophical puzzles to be resolved---those related to ethics, value, and meaning---stem primarily from the subject as _shutai_ and not from the subject as _shukan_.  While the view of the subject as observer has its place---certainly theorizing is a part of human existence---it is a *[déformation professionnelle][fr]* to so valorize the arm chair that we give it priority over practical action in our understanding of human existence. As mentioned in chapter, a common thread in East Asian thought is Wang Yangming’s slogan _zhixing heyi_ [知行合一][zh], “Unity of knowledge and practice.” It is immersion in this culture of thought that led Watsuji to be critical that strain of Cartesian thinking in which one sits in one’s study and attempts to prove the existence of the other. The attempt shows its own superfluousness in the writing:

> _Writing_ “only the _I_ is a certainty” is a self-contradiction because writing is the expression in letters of words, and words are something that develop only in the possession of a partner to live with and speak with.  (WTZ 10:52)

We forget that there’s no one out there who could read our disproof of solipsism without already disbelieving in solipsism because we neglect the importance of the body and its practical conduct in favor of a view of the subject as observer. In aesthetics as well, we must be careful not to elevate the observing subject over the agentive subject if we are to escape the pitfall of neglecting the importance of action to forming judgments.

One approach to talking about norms in aesthetic judgment has been to couch claims about what constitutes good and bad taste in terms of the reactions of a hypothetical “suitable spectator” or an “ideal observer.” In this framework, good taste is that judgment offered by an ideal observer. The “correct” judgment to render about an aesthetic question just is one that agrees with an ideal observer. Richard Wollheim, for example, claims in “On Pictorial Representation” that we can judge the success of representation in a picture on the basis of whether, “if a suitable spectator looks at the picture, he will, other things equal, have the appropriate experience” (396).<!--other people?∞--> However, from the perspective on the subject just mentioned it is clear that rather than thinking in terms of an ideal _observer_ or suitable _spectator_ (_shukan_), we should think in terms of ideal _embodied agents_ or appropriate _actors_ (_shutai_). When we think about ideal observers, we are left without a toehold from which to climb to understanding of what makes an observer ideal. We search in vain for a formal explanation of the process of observation if we emphasize the subjective side of judgment or the formal properties of the object if we emphasize the objective side of judgment. In neither case, however, are we able to come up with a satisfying explanation for why those formal properties and no others are the correct ones.

While the perspective of passive aesthetic experience is important to understand, we also need to see that this perspective is itself part of the embodied activities undertaken by the subject. We not only stumble into beauty, but we actively seek it out as artists and as audiences. We prepare our minds to receive beauty by undertaking actions which open us to the possibility of disinterested enjoyment. The physical activity of walking to the theater or signing one’s name in the guestbook at the gallery should not be overlooked when analyzing the aesthetic experience, because these activities allow our bodies to help physically prepare the mindset of distancing and dissolution which will be needed. Even in a seemingly passive observer, the imagination races ahead and behind, painting the picture with the artist, singing the aria with the prima donna, composing the sonnet with the poet. Imaginative productivity accompanies any receptive aesthetic experience. Because our perception is aspectival, the practical judgments we make about the world around us are already built into everyday experience in its most basic form. We judge that the chair is for sitting and the body we see in the distance is a friend with whom we share a relationship. To be a “suitable spectator” for forming an aesthetic judgment therefore requires not only that we take up a certain cognitive stance, but that also that we engage in certain behaviors and activities that will both cultivate and demonstrate our suitability.[^fn4-3]

[^fn4-3]: Space restrictions do not permit the elaboration of the parallel here, but attentive readers will note the similarity between this and Wittgenstein’s remarks concerning the importance of our “forms of life” to understanding one another. “If a lion could talk, we could not understand him” (*Philosophical Investigations*, p. 190). “What has to be accepted, the given, is---so one could say---_forms of life_” (p. 192).

####Subject as plural
Thinking of the subject of aesthetic as _shutai_---actively embodied---rather than _shukan_---passively contemplating---leads us to another aspect of the subject. Human existence is a constant dialectical movement of double negation between the individual and social moments in our persistent relationships. Accordingly, it is misleading to think of the subject of aesthetic judgment as a purely individual. In _Milieu_ (_Fūdo_ [風土][ja], also referred to in English as _Climate and Culture_), a middle period work by Watsuji, he explains that treating the mind and body non-dualistically as an embodied subject requires that we go beyond the study of individual persons to look at how persons come together to form communities. This is because,

> The subjectivity (_shutaisei_ [主体性][ja]) of the physical body depends on the spatiotemporal structure of human existence as its ground. It follows that a subjective physical body (_nikutai_ [肉体][ja]) is not an isolated physical body. A subjective physical body has a dynamic structure as though it were becoming united while isolated and becoming isolated in unity. (WTZ 8:17)

While our individual subjectivities are an important aspect of aesthetic judgment, so too are our social subjectivities. To paint a full picture of aesthetic judgment, we must see how both are constructed. The basis of this construction is that we are actively embodied subjects in addition to being passively contemplating subjects. From the perspective of the passively contemplating subject, the problem of solipsism looms large, but the actively embodied subject dissolves the problem of solipsism just by writing about it. In writing, we engage with other human beings and so expand our cognition beyond ourselves.

In chapter two, we looked at this quotation from Watsuji’s _Study of Ethics_:

> It cannot be that the consciousness of the *I* who feels the beauty of a picture and the consciousness of Thou towards the same picture are completely independent things. We are feeling the same beauty together. The difference in the way that two people feel can only be compared on the ground of this shared feeling. (WTZ 10:76)

According to conventional philosophical anthropologies, my feelings are *mine* and therefore completely private. This leads to a crisis about how shared taste can even be possible. Watsuji’s anthropology, however, denies the presupposition that the individual self is atomic and substantive. As a result, we should not be surprised to see Watsuji arguing that “the interpenetration of the consciousnesses of self and other is especially prominent in its emotional aspect” (WTZ 10:74) because,

> In situations where the persistent relationship (_aidagara_ [間柄][ja]) of self and other is extremely intimate and the communal existence is acutely realized, the _I_ shares an identical emotion with the other. (WTZ 10:74)

Because the subject is not only individual but also communal, feelings can arise in the subject as communal then be shared by subjects as individuals and vice versa. In certain circumstances, these feelings are not just similar but the same. Watsuji gives the example of parents who lose a child. The sorrow they feel is not just similar, “the sorrow is for the parents a communal sorrow, thus they feel an *identical* sorrow together” (WTZ 10:74). Because the source of the sorrow is the shared in common, it is right to call it an identical emotion felt by two individual persons. The subject of this experience is the *we* who feel sorrow, not just the *I*.

Such sharing of intense feelings is what makes comparing aesthetic judgments and the subsequent creation of canons of taste in the art world possible. That such canons exist is an observable fact of everyday experience, so it is conventional anthropology that needs to be on the defensive here, since it renders these canons difficult to explain. If each individual is truly isolated, there is no sharing of feeling. If there is no sharing of feeling, how can there be agreement or disagreement? Disputation requires a common subject matter about which to dispute.

On the other hand, everyday experience also shows us that very often aesthetic judgments fail to cohere. The saying *[de gustibus non disputandum est][la]* (“there's no arguing taste”) is well established for a reason. The Watsujian anthropology being employed here is also well positioned to explain this phenomenon. Double negation requires a moment of individuation as well as community. We create our self-identities by both concurring with the group and dissenting from it. Initially, I take my background of taste judgments from those around me. I then negate some of those judgments in order to create a unique self-identity. Finally, the separation of the individual from the group must be resolved through the change of my taste or the group’s taste if a new union is to be established and the cycle to continue. By dissenting from the group, we create the possibility of creative evolution in our shared taste. On the other hand, there must be a moment when we come back to the group if what is established is to go beyond an idiosyncratic preference. Only when both aspects of judgment exist together is there a productive synthesis of communal taste.

One clear illustration of the process by which communities of aesthetic taste emerge is gustatory taste. Watsuji writes,

> we *divide* food to taste it. The taste is on the tongue of each person. But can those tastes be *separate tastes*? In the case of dividing and tasting some sugar, do we not taste *an identical sweetness*? Should one person feel the sugar to be bitter, we will immediately treat that person as sick. That is, we will handle it as a case of one being temporarily deprived of the ability to taste an identical sweetness. […] If bodily sensation were something that separated people from each other, such things could not be. (WTZ 10:80)

In the aesthetic experience of tasting delicious food, for instance, one nearly loses oneself in rapture to the flavorful sensation of the dish. However, this experience of partial self-dissolution is always made possible first by specific cultural structures. In *Milieu*, Watsuji puts the issue so:

> It is not the case that human beings first desired either livestock or fish and then chose either stock farming or fishing. Rather, we came to desire either livestock or fish on the basis of stock farming or fishing being climatologically (_fūdo-teki_ [風土的][ja]) determined. In the same way, the determinant of vegetarianism or carnivorism also is not ideology, as it is seen by the vegetarians, but our milieu (_fūdo_ [風土][ja]). So, our appetites are not aimed at something like food in general but are directed towards food created already in the manner of a specific cuisine which has been prepared since long ago. What we desire when we are hungry is bread or rice, beefsteak or sashimi, and so on. A form of cuisine expresses a people’s longstanding climatological self-apprehension. (WTZ 8:13)

Before we can experience a meeting of subject-object, there must be a coming together of individuals as a collective subject in a society. The food we eat is an instance of American food or French cuisine or Szechuan cooking, etc. or some fusion thereof. We grow up eating certain foods and develop our tastes and desires within these parameters, even as we grow beyond them. Hence our understanding of the subject of aesthetic experience can never be limited to an appreciation for the individual’s experience alone, but we must also appreciate the ways in which the communal whole enjoys the aesthetic experience as a subject. As Watsuji writes in _Study of Ethics_,

> The discrimination between approval and disapproval is itself from the first both individual and social, and it cannot be understood from outside the structure of human existence. (WTZ 10:135)

Hence when thinking of aesthetic judgment, the important contrast is not that between "objective" and "subjective" forms of judgment but that between the subject as individual and the subject as communal, both of which must exist in on-going double negation.

###What is an object?
Having looked again at the subject, we must also look again at the object. In the last chapter, we suggest that an object is that which objects. Another way to look at the question is suggested by the Japanese word _sonzai_ [存在][ja], which means “to exist” or “to be.” A. C. Graham notes in “ ‘Being’ in Western Philosophy Compared With *Shih/Fei* and *Yu/Wu* in Chinese Philosophy” that there has been a persistent tendency in Western philosophy to conflate the existential and predicative senses of “to be.” This tendency is not seen in Chinese thought, and fallacies which rest on such an equivocation are difficult to translate into classical Chinese. As Watsuji notes (WTZ 10:23--4, WTZ 4:547), Japanese also distinguishes sharply between the existential verb (subject _ga aru_ [がある][ja]) and the predicative copula (subject predicate _dearu_ [である][ja]). _Sonzai_ is for the most part equivalent to _ga aru_ just as the English “exist” is equivalent to “there is.” The value of _sonzai_ for Japanese philosophy is that because it cannot be used to say that “_A_ is _B_,” the grammar of the language makes it clear for a thing to exist is not the same as it having certain predicates. Watsuji asks rhetorically in _Study of Ethics_, “Can _sonzai_ be used as a copula or to show _[essentia][la]_? No, certainly not” (WTZ 10:23--4). Thus, the Japanese language precludes the tendency towards essentialism and eternalism as seen in some Western thinking. For a certain thing to “exist” need not require that the thing maintain certain properties. As with Watsuji’s theory of anthropology, existence can be a dynamic interplay of negation and double negation rather than the maintenance of a simple static essence.

Watsuji further looks at the word _sonzai_ in terms of its component characters [存][zh] (modern standard Mandarin _cun_) and [在][zh] (also _zai_). In Chinese, where the compound was first used, _cun_ meant to protect against loss and _zai_ meant to be or remain in a particular place, hence as a compound _sonzai_ suggests preservation over time and persistence in space (WTZ 10:24). Where the various Western terms for “being” suggest that to continue to exist is the default state of things, _sonzai_ suggests that objects may only attempt to resist the impermanence of things temporarily. An object, therefore, exists in a certain place for a certain time in contradistinction to the background of the environment in which it arises. The object works to perpetuate itself while it can but eventually fails and is lost in the flow of time.

On top of this, Watsuji further claims that our understanding of _sonzai_ must be in terms of _human_ existence, even when we speak of the existence of objects. For an object to exist is for it to exist in a certain place for a certain time, but if, as Watsuji argues with Kant and Heidegger, time and space are parts of the structure of human beings, then the existence object itself has to be understood in terms of its relation to the human subject: 

> If, as we said before, _son_ is the self-possession of the subject (_shutai_ [主体][ja]) and _zai_ is being within human relations, then “existence” (_sonzai_) is simply the self-holding of the subject as a persistent relationship (_aidagara_ [間柄][ja]).  We may moreover say simply that “existence” is “the linkage of human conduct.” Thus, in the strictest sense, existence is merely “human existence.” The existence of a thing is no more than an anthropomorphic way of speaking about “the being of a thing” (_mono no yū_ [物の有][ja]) which springs from human existence. (WTZ 10:25)

In “The Question of the Japanese Language and Philosophy” (_Nihongo to Tetsugaku no Mondai_ [日本語と哲学の問題][ja], WTZ 4:506--51 part of _Study of the History of the Japanese Spirit II_, _Zoku Nihon Seishin-Shi Kenkyū_ [続日本精神史研究][ja]), Watsuji looks at the terms _ga aru_ (existential) and _dearu_ (predicative) in Japanese and finds both of them rooted in human subjectivity as an active embodied presence in the world. At the most basic level, we encounter in objects then define them as predicates by negating or limiting them. Hence, the qualities with which we predicate the objects are secondary to the more primary existence of those objects in experience:

> in general "there is something" (_mono ga aru_ [ものがある][ja]) may be said to mean a human being possesses (_motsu_ [有つ][ja]) it. If this is so, that _ga aru_ becomes _dearu_ through limitation is because the way that a human being possesses it has been limited. In the case of our saying, “There is a potted tree in the garden; it is a beautiful tree,” it is a form of limitation showing in words that a human being possesses the potted tree and its being possessed beautifully. That is, it is possessed in a way that is cherishing and admiring. Seen in this way, both _ga aru_ and _dearu_ belong to human existence, and _de aru_ becomes an expression of the way of that existence (*sonzai*) is limited. (WTZ 4:549)

This provides a vital clue to the nature of objects as possessed by us but separated from us through negation.

Watsuji’s _Milieu_ provides another vivid illustration of the way that our subjective judgments about objects are embodied and shared. Think of standing outside in the cold with an acquaintance. What will you say? Almost certainly, “Whew, sure is cold, huh?” Is the cold that you are feeling the _same_ as the cold that your acquaintance feels when you say this? Modern Western philosophers tended to treat the feeling of heat or coolness in objects as a secondary quality rather than a primary quality, which means that for them you are _not_ feeling the same cold.[^fn4-4] You feel only your own cold in your own mind, and on the basis of this feeling infer a similar feeling may exist within the mind of your acquaintance. However, since you have never been your acquaintance, it is not clear how well rationally grounded this inferential process could be. Watsuji sidesteps this difficulty by affirming what common sense tells us, namely that the cold I feel is the same cold that you feel:

[^fn4-4]: Whitehead's sarcastic rebuttal to the doctrine of secondary qualities in _Science and the Modern World_ is close to definitive: “The poets are entirely mistaken. They should address their lyrics to themselves, and should turn them into odes of self-congratulation on the excellency of the human mind. Nature is a dull affair, soundless, scentless, colorless; merely the hurrying of material, endlessly, meaninglessly” (54). Everyday experience so throughly refutes this colorless view of nature that the doctrine of secondary qualities must be flawed.

> just as there is no obstacle to our saying, “*we* feel the cold,” it is we who bodily experience the cold and not just the *I*. *We feel the cold communally*. It is just because of this that we use a word that expresses this cold with one another as *an everyday greeting*. Even if amongst us the way of feeling of cold is different from person to person, this is possible on the ground of feeling the cold communally. Without this ground, knowledge of the bodily experience of cold in another *I* would be utterly impossible. (WTZ 8:10)

The basis of Watsuji’s conclusion here is that,

> An intentional object is not some kind of psychological content. It follows that coldness as the bodily experience of an independently existing objective cold air could not be the intentional object. When we *feel* the cold, we do not feel the “sensation” of cold, rather we directly *feel* the chill of the outside air, that is, the cold air. In other words, cold as “the thing felt” in intentional bodily experience is not “something subjective” (_shukan-teki na mono_ [主観的なもの][ja]) but “something objective.” Therefore, we may say that the intentional “relation” in itself of *feeling* the cold is already related to the chilliness of the outside air. (WTZ 8:9)

The cold that we feel is an object which we feel inside yet at the same time it is an object which we find ourselves out in the midst of:

> When the cold is first discovered, we ourselves are already out in the cold. Therefore, that which is most primordially “being outside” is not a thing or object like the cold air, but we ourselves. “Going outside” is a fundamental prescript of our own structure, and intentionality as well is founded on nothing else. (WTZ 8:10)

Following Heidegger, Watsuji calls this state of existence in the world as a form of standing outside of oneself “ex-sistere.” This going outside of oneself is the basis of space and time, which are parts of the structure of human existence. Hence when we see an object in the world, we are at once seeing something foreign to ourselves---an object which is objecting---but also something that is a part of us. The object exists in a space at a time, and that space and time are part of the shared structure of the human subject. To discover the object is to discover the _I_ opposed to the object and to discover the _we_ who gather around the object. 

An extended quote from _Study of Ethics_ is illustrative of Watsuji’s point:

> For example, when we *love* or *think fondly of* a row of ginkgo trees, we are treating the row of trees as a *Thou*. It follows that it is not the case that we first find ourselves surrounded by simple “things” and then infer the subsistence of a special species among those things, that is, one with another *I*, and then finally reach the phase of loving the trees by applying an analogy from my relation to the other *I* to my relation to the trees. When we find the trees, they are already trees with a character given by the ground of human existence, for instance as a row of ginkgo trees. The *we* who finds the row of trees is the *we* who already socially created things like rows of trees and not a *we* which must find these things inferentially. Whatever sort of a thing it is we find, we have already found that object before as a *Thou*. In this sense, the spatiality of the subject (*shutai*) acts as the means of finding objective things. In other words, generally speaking, the first moment in the establishment of an object is when a subject becomes a *Thou* or a *He/She* and opposes the *I*. (WTZ 10:188)

Our aesthetic appreciation of even natural objects like trees is mediated through the conceptual apparatus we possess as human beings in a community, and it is out of our communal humanity that these things emerge as potential objects of appreciation. 

If this is the case, can Watsuji be said to be a realist about the object? Is his object just an idealist’s figment of the imagination? Is Watsuji’s account of existence so anthropocentric that it drains the outside world of its reality? I will argue that in spite of the superficial appeal of these accusations, Watsuji is still a realist at heart. In “I Touch What I Saw,” Arindam Chakrabarti provides four tests for whether one is a realist about an apple:

> (A) The apple is distinct from just an experience or idea of an apple.<br />
> (B)  The apple is distinct from just its red-color, its coldish touch, smooth texture and sweet taste, and also from just a series or set of these qualities. <br />
> \(C)  The apple that I now touch (or bite or smell) is the same as the apple that I saw a while ago. <br />
> (D)  The apple that I see is the same as the apple that you see. (105--6)

(A) must be true if Watsuji’s phenomenological account of ex-sistere is correct.  An apple is distinct from the experience of an apple, because the apple is a thing outside of the mind that is intended in the experience of the apple. (B) must be true if the distinction between the predicative and existential uses of “being” that we have been making is correct. For X to be an apple is not the same as saying that an apple is, so the apple is more than just a collection of predicates. \(C) follows from the _son_ aspect of _sonzai_: existence is a preservation against loss spread out over time. As for (D), it follows directly from our discussion of the subject as plural. You and I share a world, and on occasion we even share communal feelings. Of course, we may also share identical objects.

In spite of this, it would be too quick to say that Watsuji is a straightforward realist, whether about subjects or objects. Rather, as a Buddhist, he gives an account that attempts to steer a “Middle Way” between realism and nihilism, and this leads us to affirm the existence of objects on the conventional level while denying their substantiality on the ultimate level and positing emptiness as the source of the creative impermanence of things.

Returning then to the question of aesthetics, what is the object of aesthetic judgment? The object, as we have seen, emerges from the active, plural subject understood as the space of persistent relationships, but it also stands outside of the subject drawing the subject away from itself. There is a delicate interplay to be had. Should the subject stay where it is and refuse ex-sistere, there can be no object, but on the other hand, should the subject expand too far, it will swallow the object up and there will be no ex-sistere because the self has merely come into itself. Accordingly, we must firmly emphasize the dynamic, dialectical nature of the movement of double negation. As the term _sonzai_ implies, the subject-object complex has its existence as a temporary swelling in an ocean of impermanence. For a moment these waves roil through a field of relations, but always with the danger that a wave that grows too large becomes nothing more than the surface of the sea. What connects subjects and objects is that both spring from and return to emptiness itself. As we shall shortly see, understanding this is the key to understanding the basis of understanding aesthetic judgment and the appreciation of the object.

###The attitude of the critic
<!--∞Maybe goes to chapter 3?-->
Having looked at the nature of the subject and the object, we may begin our investigation into aesthetic judgment by asking about what attitude is a precondition for the relation of the subject toward the object if criticism is to be meaningful. One approach to criticism is to be critical, that is, to criticize. One can search the object closely for faults in order to seize on them and present them to its creator and others. This attitude, however, is clearly of more use in fostering one’s reputation among fellow connoisseurs than it is for allowing one to aesthetically engage with the object. It has its place, but it is not strictly aesthetic. 

In a short essay entitled “Art Criticism” (_Geijutsu Hihyō_ [芸術批評][ja]), Watsuji explains his approach and the approach of the French philosopher Jean-Marie Guyau (1854--1888) to criticism. Both are opposed to the brand of criticism that seeks only to tear down. Watsuji interprets Guyau’s view as being, “one who we ought to call a critic is one who is best sings praises to the beautiful and also one who is best able to explain this praise to others” (WTZ 17:189). While agreeing with this sentiment, Watsuji feels that we must not lose sight of the source of criticizing criticism either. In his view, “The ideal critic knows best how to praise beauty, while also being at the same time the most sensitive towards the ugly” (WTZ 17:190). When the critic criticizes, it should not be out of a desire to impress others with one’s snobbish sophistication, but out of a sensitivity to the ways that object came so close to achieving greatness but fell short.

The attitude a critic must possess in order to simultaneously praise the beautiful and criticize the bad is, Watsuji and Guyau agree, love. Love, of course, can be understood in many ways beyond even the traditional Greek distinctions between [ἀγάπη][el] (“charitable love”), [ἔρως][el] (“erotic love”), [φιλία][el] (“brotherly love”), and [στοργή][el] (“familial affection”). To add in distinctions from the East Asian tradition, we might also mention [慈悲][zh] (Chinese _cibei_, Japanese _jihi_, “compassion”),  [戀][zh] (*lian*, _koi_, “yearning love”), [愛][zh] (_ai_, _ai_, “possessive love”), and [仁][zh] (_ren_, _jin_, “humane conduct”). Each of these concepts of love has a different shade of meaning which has evolved historically and each reveals a different aspect of the attitude needed for aesthetic judgment. The thread that runs through them as concepts is the sense of outward yearning concern. In _Study of Ethics_, Watsuji mentions one view of love given by Hegel in _Philosophy of Right_ (WTZ 10:87). I believe Hegel captures something of commonality of our conceptions of love:

> Love is in general the consciousness of the unity of myself with another. I am not separate and isolated, but win my self-consciousness only by renouncing my independent existence, and by knowing myself as unity of myself with another and of another with me. […] The first element in love is that I will to be no longer an independent self-sufficing person, and that, if I were such a person, I should feel myself lacking and incomplete. The second element is that I gain myself in another person, in whom I am recognized, as he again is in me. Hence love is the most tremendous contradiction, incapable of being solved by the understanding. Nothing is more obstinate than this scrupulosity of self-consciousness, which, though negated, I yet insist upon as something positive. Love is both the source and solution of this contradiction. As a solution it is an ethical union.[^fn4-5]

[^fn4-5]: Hegel, _Philosophy of Right_, §158, p. 139.

Watsuji summarizes, “love is the contradiction that to abandon oneself is to acquire oneself” (WTZ 10:88). For our purposes, what love must mean is a willingness to go beyond one’s horizons while accepting the otherness of the object. That is, love desires the other without needing to possess it or smother it. The feeling of disinterested enjoyment rests on just this. 

In Plato’s _Symposium_, Aristophanes tells a myth about the origin of love. Once, human beings were wholes with four arms, four legs, and two faces, but now we have been divided into halves as punishment by the gods. As a result, we spend our lives searching for our lives in search of a lover to complete us, that is, searching for our other halves:

> Why should this be so? It’s because, as I said, we used to be complete wholes in our original nature, and now “Love” is the name for our pursuit of wholeness, for our desire to be complete. (192e)

The form of love that makes criticism possible is similar in that it too is a drive to unify in cleavage what was originally together without division. In aesthetic judgment, we are not just looking for another person to complete us, but for oneness with the emptiness out of which subject and object co-arise. This return with difference is the foundation of aesthetic goodness and the drive that compels our experiences to evolve in progressively novel forms.

To be sure, an overemphasis on the word “love” as the attitude of the critic can lead to a misunderstanding of what aesthetic judgment calls for. As we said above, the critic must always be ready to criticize the ugliness of the ugly. While this is compatible with a deeper understanding of love, it easily becomes obscured if our concept of love is too shallow. Another way of conceptualizing the attitude needed for aesthetic judgment that may prevent this misunderstanding is as empathy. The word “empathy” was coined as a translation of the German *[Einfühlung][de]*, which was popularized by German philosopher Theodor Lipps (1851--1914).[^fn4-6] Watsuji mentions Lipps in his unfinished notes on art theory and wrote about him several times in his early work, _Revival of the Idols_ (_Guzō Saikō_ [偶像再興][ja]).[^fn4-7] The German *[Einfühlung][de]* and the Greco-English “empathy” are both compounds meaning “in feeling.” The preposition “in” suggest that while outside the thing being empathized with, we nevertheless enter into it ecstatically. We feel from our position as subjects into the the position of the object. In doing so, we come together with our fellow appreciators, the artist, and---most importantly---the object itself.

[^fn4-6]: See the Oxford English Dictionary entry on empathy.

[^fn4-7]: See _Lipps and Nietzsche_ (_Rippusu to Niiche_ [リップスとニイチェ][ja], WTZ 17:167--171), _Lipp’s Individualism_ (_Rippusu no Kojinshugi_ [リップスの個人主義][ja], WTZ 17:172--174), and _Lipp’s Warning_ (_Rippusu no Keikoku_ [リップスの警告][ja], WTZ 17:175--178).

###The source of normativity in aesthetic judgment
Now that we have reconsidered the nature of the subject and object of aesthetic judgment and the attitude need for aesthetic criticism, we may begin to dig into the roots of its very possibility. How and why is aesthetic judgment possible? As Watsuji explains in _Study of Ethics_ though there is regional variation in morality---for example, one society may approve of human sacrifice while another condemns it---this does not undermine the universality of the basis of ethics. In all societies what is condemned are actions that undermine the trust basis of that society and what is praised are actions that reinforce the trust basis of that society. We must therefore look for the aesthetic analogue of trust to explain what is relative and what is universal in aesthetic judgment.

To begin to understand aesthetic normativity, it is helpful to look at the phenomenon of conscience in ethics. How is it that we as individual members of society feel the call of conscience? If values are being imposed on us from without in order to preserve trust fabric of society, then it is not clear why as individuals we should feel an *inner* impulse towards a morality made to preserve *outer* order. In that case, moral education is a kind of deformation of the person by which the individual is trained to ignore her authentic desires and interests and produce within herself a feeling of subordination to the order outside of her. Could it be that our call of conscience is really the result of a super-ego that is essential alien to us? Watsuji argues no. In the determination of guilt by a court of law, the one who accuses me stands in for society as whole, but in an affliction of conscience, the one who accuses me is the very emptiness at the heart of my self. In spite of the great degree of social determination that undoubtably goes into the formation of conscience, when we truly feel the call of conscience it does not feel to us as something coming from without but it feels as though it was coming from our inmost personality. 

The reason for this should already be clear from our reexamination of the subject. When we understand the subject correctly, we see it as arising out of the negation of the emptiness that stands prior to the individual or the community. As such, the call of conscience does not arise as an external voice speaking for society but as an internal voice speaking for the authentic source of the subject. As we previously quoted Watsuji,

> already existing persistent relationships (*aidagara* [間柄][ja]) […] are *authenticity* (*honraisei* [本来性][ja]) as the origin out of which we ultimately come. (WTZ 10:195)

As we said before Watsuji is at heart an existential ethicist, but unlike the other existentialists, he argues that authenticity comes from a return to our persistent relationships as the source of our existence, rather than from an insistence on the freedom and substantiality of the individual.[^fn4-8]

[^fn4-8]: For what it’s worth, even in traditional existential ethics, the substantiality of the individual tends to dissolve in the face of some great whole, such as God in Christian existentialism or Nothingness/the Absurd for atheistic existentialism (cf. WTZ 10:85). Watsuji’s innovation is to see that if we insist on the transcendent permeability of the self, there is no equally good reason not to allow for the horizontal permeability of the self.

Watsuji explicitly links his discussion of conscience to Mencius (WTZ 10:318), who coined the term [良心][zh], which evolved eventually into the term _ryōshin_ in Japanese and _liangxin_ in modern standard Mandarin and is used to translate the English word “conscience.” In the Warring States period, there was a debate about whether moral appropriateness ([義][zh] _yi_) was _nei_ [內][zh] (roughly speaking, “internal”) or _wai_ [外][zh] (“external”), part of which is preserved in _Mencius_ 6A. There have been various interpretations of the exact meaning of this distinction, but we may on a loose reading take it that they wanted to know whether morality is in some ways dependent on the dispositions of the individual or if moral normativity can be imposed on the individual from without by completely impersonal formal considerations.[^fn4-9] For his part, Mencius claims that our sense of the appropriate must be _nei_ even as it responds to conditions in the world. I argue that what Mencius means by this is not that morality is “subjective” in the sense of being determined only by the individual, but that morality is _nei_ in the sense that it originates in our most inner and authentic self even as it is importantly interpenetrated by our relationships with others---in other words, it is subjective in the sense of a _shutai_ [主体][ja] which we have been exploring here.

[^fn4-9]: Kwong-Loi Shun’s _Mencius and Early Chinese Thought_, pp. 94--112 is a good starting point for this and other debates surrounding the interpretation of the _Mencius_. Shun defends an interpretation “which takes the internality of _yi_ [[義][zh]] to be the claim that one’s recognition of what is _yi_ derives from certain features of the heart/mind” (103--4).

Mencius and his interlocutors agree that one can take  gustatory taste---savoring a roast or wanting a drink of water---as paradigmatic example of _nei_ (_Mencius_ 6A.4 and 6A.5). Mencius points out that these tastes, while paradigmatically internal, are nevertheless respondent to external conditions. On a hot day, I would like a cold drink, but on a cold day, I would like a hot drink. My wanting a particular kind of drink on the basis of these external circumstances cannot be the result of some coercive education in inauthenticity. As we saw above, our tastes are communal and shared although also intimately subjective. My desire for meat is culturally imposed but also personally felt. It is a product of the subject as both communal and individual. If our hungers were not authentic---if the desire for food is not _nei_---then there are no authentic desires to be had. In the same way, argues Mencius, our sense of what is appropriate must respond to external circumstances (and should it fail to respond it would be an error, just as it is an error to desire salt water in a desert), but it nevertheless the internality of the sense of appropriateness which gives it jurisdiction with which to compel us. 

In Watsuji’s language, we may state this same idea somewhat differently. Legitimate compulsion of the individual can only arise from the source of the individual, that is, from the subject, but the subjective origin of this compulsion does not mean that it is only a matter of what one particular person feels, since the subject is not only individual. In our everyday experience, it is possible for social structures seemingly outside of the individual such as the family, community, or state to compel the individual, but this does not mean that they can exercise their authority insofar as they are external. They have authority only insofar as they are constitutive of one as a person. Watsuji explains in the *Study of Ethics*, 

> A family or a state is something able as a human ethical totality to demand obedience of individuals, but it is not from the standpoint of the family or state alone that this demand has the right to claim obedience. (WTZ 10:130) 

If it is not as human ethical totalities that these institutions speak authoritatively, on whose behalf are they speaking? A human-ethical totality has the authority to compel an individual just to the degree that it authentically speaks for the betweenness out which both it and the individual arise. That is, the individual and the totality must be woven together in a fabric of trust. Because the source of the individual and the social whole is the same, the one is on occasion able to speak for the other as the voice of its autonomous subject. This means both that the state is able to compel the citizen to follow its (just) laws and that the citizen is able compel the state to reform its unjust laws. The basis for both forms of compulsion is the mutual dependence of the two: the individual could not be who she is without her state, and the state could not exist without its individuals. At its best, the relationship of the citizen and the state is one of virtuosic mutual contribution and constitution. 

We may now apply this understanding of the internality of conscience and morality to the normativity of aesthetic judgment by analogy to fashion. In all known human societies there have been some modes of body adornment considered appropriate and some considered inappropriate. One may choose to wear a uniform or not, but no one living in a society can drop out of the fashion race (though many have tried). Whether one chooses to wear what is considered socially appropriate, chooses rebel against it, or even chooses not to reflect much on fashion at all; in any event one is intimately wrapped up in fashion. Fashion is closely tied to our self-identities, and in particular it is closely tied to the cultural construction of gender out of more basic sexual differences, hence written and unwritten sumptuary laws dictate the fashion choices and the internal fashion sensibilities of individuals. Fashion is, therefore, a prototypical illustration of what Watsuji calls “the linkages of conduct” (_kōi-teki renkan_ [行為的連関][ja]).

But if the fashion choices I make are imposed on me from outside---and they certainly are, otherwise it would not just so happen that men in the West wear shirts and pants, whereas men in other cultures have worn robes, etc., etc.---then why do I feel as though when I dress I put on clothes that reflect _my_ taste in clothing? Has the outside force of fashion education deformed my authentic sartorial feelings? Has my individual, “subjective” fashion sensibility been trampled by the collective, “objective” tastes of my society?

Watsuji argues to the contrary that fashion is an everyday experience of a kind of communal consciousness:

> The phenomenon of “fashion” shows this kind of communal consciousness in a particularly magnified form. It appears as a further narrowed _common taste_ within forms of food, clothing, and shelter already specified nationally and historically. Even if particular individuals had not been conscious of them as their own authentic tastes at the start, they feel this common taste as their own taste. And then something that departs from this taste is felt to be maybe funny or perhaps ugly. (WTZ 10:79)

In other words, in fashion our aesthetic norms originate outside of the particular individual, but they are nevertheless felt as the subjective tastes of individuals because those individuals are ultimately expressions through negation of the prior betweenness. Society may help shape my taste in fashion, but it is still _my_ taste. At the same time, however, by changing my taste in fashion, it is possible for me to change society’s taste in fashion. The two forms of taste are mutually entailing and are ultimately expressions of the ways in which I as individual am made in part by the fashion of my society and my society is made in part by me.

Hence there is a voice which is able to speak with authority about the kinds of taste experiences we “should” be having when we enter into an aesthetic experience. It is the voice of the society as it expresses itself as the source of the individual. Because this voice is trans-personal, it is possible for us as members of a community to discuss our tastes productively. It is not entirely “subjective” in the sense of being entirely individual-relative. On the other hand, since the voice is also the voice of the inmost source of the individual, this voice is “subjective” in the sense of being a part of the subject and able to, at times, command the assent of the subject. These properties of the voice of aesthetic experience help explain why Kant felt that aesthetic judgment is universal but subjective---aesthetic judgment has a normativity that originates within the individual but extends beyond it---without thereby committing us to an implausibly universal coherence of tastes. The scope of the normativity of aesthetic judgment is only as wide as the subject itself. It extends toward anyone with whom I can have an interactive dialogue but it is not yet already extended towards “any rational being” in the absence of prior lived engagement with such beings. I share my tastes with those around me in society because those who are around me in society are a part of my subject, and I am a part of theirs. Together we render sentiments of taste normative as an expression of our interactions.

What about the other side of aesthetic judgment? Can the voice which speaks for the source of the subject also make claims on the object of aesthetic judgment? Dare we to say what an object “should” be aesthetically? When we return to our prior discussion of the object, we see that it, just as much as the subject, emerges from emptiness to exist for a short time. As the word _sonzai_ [存在][ja] implies, this existence is a spatiotemporally rooted struggle against impermanence. Therefore, the voice which speaks to me as the source of my being also has authority to speak to the object as the source of its being. As we said in the last chapter, for Watsuji, ethical good is the continual growth and development of the cycle of double negation, hence the aesthetic good is the growth and development of a harmony between the negation of distancing and the negation of dissolution. An aesthetic object is good insofar as it is able to participate in the development of such a harmony.

###Forming aesthetic judgments
We have seen that the basis of normativity in aesthetic judgment is the mutual emergence of the subject and object of judgment from emptiness. However, the actual process of concretely forming a judgment remains to be brought into sharper focus. In the last chapter, we quoted from Watsuji’s unfinished notes on art theory:

> In this sense, the aesthetic appreciator can be said to be an appreciator who “contemplates the fullness (German, *[Fülle][de]*) of the object without interest (German, *[uninteressiert][de]*)” as Moritz Geiger says. (WTZ B1:145)

The notion of the “fullness” of the object needs to be explored in further depth. How can we judge the fullness of an object? In the case of art objects, Watsuji mentions two criteria which recur in German theories of aesthetics: 

> *art works are made by human beings*. Hence the artist’s *[Wollen][de]* (German, “will”) and *[Können][de]* (“ability”) are in them. To the extent that artists are human beings, it could not be the case, whoever they are, that their *[Wollen][de]* and *[Können][de]* are so deep as to be absolutely beyond our grasp. (WTZ B1:153--4)

This leads us towards a relatively straightforward method for forming an aesthetic judgment. As I see it, the method would roughly be as follows: Before beginning, one adopts an attitude of loving empathy towards the art and the artist allowing openness towards the work. Then on the basis of knowledge about the circumstances of the production of the work to be evaluated, we infer what sort of active spectator would be suitable to view the work in question according to the original intention (*[Wollen][de]*) of the artist beyond the basic requirement of an empathetic one. (For example, one may need familiarity with prior works in a field in order to understand a particular piece.) Second, we do what is necessary to become such a active spectator. (This may involve developing one’s senses, becoming familiar with a canon, engaging with many similar works, prompting oneself in a certain way, or, in extreme cases, changing one’s style of life or values, etc.) Third, we experience the work from the vantage point of the suitable spectator and see what sort of aesthetic experiences can be produced on the basis of the work as an object. Fourth, we evaluate the execution of the artist (*[Können][de]*) according to how well the work was able to achieve the aims set beforehand. Finally, it may be necessary on the basis of what is revealed by the prior evaluation of the work to revise one’s view of suitable spectator for the work by returning to the first step, reevaluating the life of the artist, reengaging in the cultivation of suitability as spectator, and iteratively continuing the process of evaluation indefinitely in a hermeneutic circle. Hence the judgment, “this is beautiful,” can be taken to mean something like, “this will be seen as beautiful should one approach it in a manner prescribed by the work.” The fullness of an art object in this case consists of its ability to live up to the intentions which caused it to come into being.

Laying aside the various challenges that have been made to the notion of an artist’s intention more recently, the basic difficulty with this approach, as Watsuji points out in the same set of notes, is that not all aesthetic experiences are had in relation to works of art. We also have aesthetic experience of nature. However, judging those experiences is difficult because nature lacks something as straightforward as an artist’s intention to evaluate it in light of. Watsuji remarks, “towards nature any *[Einstellung][de]* (German, attitude) is permitted” (WTZ B1:154), hence settling on a suitable manner from which to approach the object (beyond the basic level of loving empathy) is significantly more complicated. This in turn complicates the identification and assessment of the fullness of the object. On the other hand, Watsuji remarks that “nature is an unfathomably infinite fountain. As our eyes deepen, so deepens nature” (WTZ B1:153). That is, the more refined our understanding of nature becomes, the more nature presents for us to understand. So long as we begin with an attitude of loving, empathetic identification with nature, we are sure to find some foothold from which to climb to a higher understanding through our interactions with the environment. The more we attune ourselves to the beauty of nature, the more beauty there is to uncover. That natural objects possess fullness is prima facie evident. The difficulty is in their assessment, but since natural objects emerge from the same emptiness as manmade objects, there must be some ground on which to form appropriate judgments of them.

In _Study of Ethics_, we read that, “The highest value is an absolute totality, and an ‘aspiration’ [English in the original] (an upward impulse or fervent wish) for it is ‘good’ (_zen_ [善][ja])” (WTZ 10:142) and this applies as much to natural objects as manmade. Objects in general can express harmony (in Japanese, _wa_ [和][ja]) through their interrelation of part and whole into an organic unity that brings the many into a new phase of higher value without eliminating the parts.[^fn4-10] Emptiness is what allows objects to overflow any attempt to reductively capture them from a top-down or a bottom-up direction. There are two ways that this can be seen. Objects can become on the one hand a source of dissatisfaction because we attempt to fix them in place; however, conversely objects are able on the other hand to be a source of satisfaction, when we are able to approach them in such a way that we allow them to be what they will be. Aesthetic judgment is a process by which we assess the harmonization of objects. In the art world, we assess this harmonization against the background of ongoing projects in the social construction of art history. In the natural world, we assess this harmonization by becoming sensitive to the “motives” of the things themselves (though of course, the social construction of the subject plays an important role in how capable we are of mustering such sensitivity). We enter into the world of objects without either assimilating them to ourselves or entirely surrendering our own selves to them. Instead we ecstatically experience the fullness of things in the mode of ex-sistere by stepping out of ourselves and into the alien.

[^fn4-10]: Whitehead writes in _Adventures of Ideas_, “the perfection of Beauty is defined as being the perfection of Harmony; and the perfection of Harmony is defined in terms of perfection of Subjective Form in detail and in final synthesis” (252--3). A full comparison to Whitehead cannot be made here, but this coincides with the core of my argument.

That having been said, this discussion of the mechanics of aesthetic judgment is still somewhat more abstract than one might like. However, further specification of aesthetic judgment cannot be made in the absence of consideration of the subject who will be making the judgment. In the language of Arthur Danto, we need to specify the “art world” that will be judging the object and the “aesthetic predicates” which are significant within that art world. This is not to totally relativize aesthetic judgment. As stated above, aesthetic judgment, whatever specific form it takes, always involves an ecstatic assessment of the fullness of things through the structure of human existence. Nevertheless, a more concrete explanation of such judgment will require a concrete background against which to explicate it. In summary, the key to aesthetic judgment is the coming together individual subjects to form a collective subject as preparation for the ecstatic appreciation of the object. In the case of art objects, the embodied subjects of the artist and the audience meet to form a community of taste. They establish norms and principles based on their mutual interaction and disinterested enjoyment of the object. The object as well, in art and nature, meets the subject and calls it out of itself into an ecstatic experience of the common ground between them. Judgment is rendered on the basis of the overall harmony felt when meeting with a loving empathy.

###Concrete examples of aesthetic judgment
####Traditional Japanese art forms
The nature of aesthetic judgment will be more clear if we can examine some specific examples against a specific cultural background. In _Milieu_, Watsuji observes that the coming together of “spirits” (_ki_ [気][ja] or in modern standard Mandarin _chi_ [氣][zh]], the hylozoistic, processual “stuff” making up the world in Chinese cosmology) is central to many of the traditional Japanese arts. In other words, aesthetic excellence requires a dynamic process in which the double negation that usually makes up the self takes a different, more ecstatic form. While I wish to contend that the coming together of spirits is central to all forms of aesthetic judgment, not just those in the traditional arts of Japan, nevertheless, these arts provide a particularly vivid demonstration of the dynamic structure I have been arguing for.

One such example is the traditional Japanese garden. Unlike English gardens which prize artificiality and symmetry, Japanese gardens utilize a very strict form of control to create an asymmetry which mimics the spontaneity nature. Watsuji writes,

> It is unified not according to geometrical proportions but according to a balance of forces which appeals to emotions, as it were, in a coming together of spirits (_ki ai_ [気合い][ja]).[^fn4-11]  In precisely the same way that “spirits come together” (_ki ga au_ [気が合う][ja]) between person and person (*hito to hito to no aida ni* [人と人との間に][ja]), the “spirits” (*ki* [気][ja]) come together between moss and stone or between stone and stone. One may see it as taking every effort to avoid a prescribed correctness in order to bring the “spirits” together. (WTZ 8:190)

[^fn4-11]: _Ki ai_ is also a term used in martial arts meaning roughly focusing one’s fighting spirit.

The aesthetic judgment of a Japanese garden rests on the feeling that every element has a harmonious place within the greater whole. Each stone is placed is relation to every other stone, yet without imposing a rigidly geometrical concept of order, just as in a good human society each person has role that harmonizes with others without reducing them to uniformity. As Confucius says in _Analects_ 13.23 harmony, (_he_ [和][zh]) is preferable to mere uniformity (_tong_ [同][zh]).

Similarly, traditional Japanese ink paintings (called *sumi-e* [墨絵][ja] or *suiboku* [水墨][ja] in Japanese) favor asymmetry over symmetry, yet the tonality of the composition of the whole must be very delicately balanced to allow the elements to form a greater harmony:

> In the composition of such pictures, one finds nothing that can be called in any sense symmetry, and yet one feels a *balance* in it without the slightest fissure. The blank space with nothing painted in it balances off the dark shadow of the sparrow as a deep and wide space, and the power held by the sparrow echoes together with the power of the few dark bamboo leaves which stand out amidst the other lighter ones. In this way, the various things occupy necessary positions from which they cannot be moved. Through the relation of balance as the coming together of spirits, we come to feel that even in a canvas like this in which the objects are just painted in the one corner there is a richness to the arrangement of things. (WTZ 8:191--2)

The rich feeling of the painting comes from the way that the viewer can imaginatively relive the creativity and spontaneity of the artist’s brush just by looking. The mind’s eye repaints the canvas and in so doing inhabits the mind of the artist who originally painted it. Each stroke is present and perfectly positioned, yet no simple, mechanical rule underlies their placement:

> it is clear just in a glance *just how good* this all is, but we are unable to prescribe any sort of basic rule for how good it is. It is grasped merely intuitively as “a coming together of spirits” without even an inch of room to move. (WTZ 8:192)

&nbsp;

Our examples can be further multiplied since as Watsuji writes, “this kind of characteristic can be found variously in Noh, tea ceremony, and Kabuki as arts in which the spirits come together” (WTZ 8:195), but let us focus more closely on these examples first. Why does Watsuji emphasize the importance of asymmetry to the coming together of spirits? A naïve reading is that the blank spaces in one’s garden, painting, and so forth straightforwardly present us with “emptiness.” William Lafleur considers this interpretation of Watsuji in “Buddhist Emptiness in the Ethics and Aesthetics of Watsuji Tetsurō,” but rejects it:

> we may not identify emptiness with some kind of non-being which has been reified and now has managed to be mirrored by and through blank spaces on an artist’s canvas. Such an interpretation would not only involve a facile mimeticism but would also involve a fundamental misunderstanding of the meaning of emptiness. For Watsuji’s point about the void on the canvas is not that it makes palpable and concrete something metaphysical called ‘non-being’ but that it operates to make possible a series of relationships and reciprocities. (247)

The more sophisticated view that Watsuji is trying to express is, according to Lafluer, about the dynamic relationality of emptiness:

> But then why does the art so conspicuously avoid and reject any representation through symmetry? The reason is, I think, that in Watsuji’s view co-dependence is dynamic and multiple rather than static and single. In formal symmetry the balance and reciprocity is limited to the single and exact counterpart of a line, angle, or whatever. The observer can always designate the formal counterpart. But in the notion of emptiness there is reciprocity between forms and entities which are in no way mirror-images of each other. The mutuality is total even between rocks and moss, what is vast and what is minuscule. This mutuality is also open-ended and multiple. Surely it is one for which the formalized and objectified balance achieved in ‘symmetry’ is inadequate. (248)

Hence, Lafluer argues, the real meaning of rejecting symmetry lies in the non-symmetric mutuality of relations with others. A parent and child, for example, cannot come into being without one another, but the relationship between parent and child is not symmetrical, because parents and children play importantly different roles in their relationship. So too, black ink of a bamboo shoot in _sumi-e_ harmonizes with the whitespace around it through their mutual co-arising---the bamboo would not be recognizable without a clear background and the background would be destroyed if the bamboo took up the whole canvas---yet the positions of the two cannot be mirrored, since each gains its dynamic existence against the potential for loss (_sonzai_ [存在][ja]) in a unique manner.

We previously explained that Sakai criticized Watsuji’s emptiness as “reductive” of the subject, but we see from example of Japanese art that the meaning of emptiness is just the opposite of reduction. Emptiness overflows in value, filling the canvas with activity, the garden with life, and the tea hut with feeling. Sakai further charges that Watsuji’s concept of persistent relationships (_aidagara_ [間柄][ja]) is overly symmetrical:

> Assuming this predetermined harmony expressed by his concept of _aidagara_, one could easily understand why Watsuji defines the being-between of the human being as the transferential and mutual penetration of consciousnesses and as the symmetrical reciprocity of you and me. Of course, such a reciprocity cannot be attained in an ordinary situation, but the predetermined harmony of totality and the individual suggests the possibility of symmetrical reciprocity, pure sympathy, and eventually “communion” as the presence of national totality. (113--4)

This interpretation of Watsuji is not wholly without grounding. Watsuji does suggest the possibility of reciprocity, sympathy, and even (somewhat concerningly) national totality; however, it is a mistake to refer to this as a “predetermined harmony” rather than a dynamic and evolving harmony, and Watsuji’s notion of relationality is, we have seen, anything but symmetrical. Rather, he emphasized the ability of non-symmetrical relationships to nevertheless find a common ground in a harmonious coming together of spirits.

####Interconnection of subjects in linked verse
An example of the coming together of spirits worthy of an extended examination can be found in Japanese linked verse, called _renga_ [連歌][ja] or *renku* [連句][ja]. Linked verse is by its nature a collaborative process governed by the chances product of many imaginations rather than the singular vision of a lead poet. In it, each poet contributes a verse which connects to the verse immediately before it, but not necessarily in continuity with the poem before that. Through this process, a group of poets would spend the evening creating an aesthetic performance in which the perspective of each poem shifts radically when read in juxtaposition with the poem after it rather than before it. 

R\. H\. Blyth provides an example of linked verse in the first volume of his _Haiku_. It was composed in 1690 by Bashō ([芭蕉][ja], 1644--1694),[^fn4-12] Kyorai, Bonchō, and Shihō and recorded in _Saru Mino_ [猿蓑][ja] (*The Monkey’s Straw Coat*). For brevity, I will excerpt only the first three verses of the thirty-six verse sequence:

[^fn4-12]: Bashō is now often referred to as a haiku poet (including by Blyth below), but readers should bear in mind that this designation is anachronistic. In Bashō’s time, the initial verse of a linked verse sequence was referred to as a *hokku* [発句][ja]. The term *haiku* [俳句][ja] was coined by Masaoka Shiki ([正岡 子規][ja], 1867--1902) to refer to *hokku* which exist independently from a linked verse sequence. While Bashō certainly wrote what we would now call haiku, to properly understand his career it is important to recall that he considered himself a master of *renga*, not merely isolated verse.

> 去来: 鳶の羽も刷ぬはつしぐれ<br /> > 芭蕉: 一ふき風の木の葉しづまる<br /> > 凡兆: 股引の朝からぬるゝ川こえて<br /> > <br />
> Kyorai: _Tobi no ha mo /kai-tsukuroinu / hatsu shigure_<br /> > Bashō: _Hito fuki kaze no / ki no ha shizumaru_<br /> > Bonchō: _Momo hike no / asa kara nururu / kawa koete_<br /> > <br />
> Kyorai: Its feathers / The kite has preened / In the first winter rain.<br />
> <br />
> Bashō: A gust of wind blows the leaves; / They are quiet.<br />
> <br />
> Bonchō: The breeches wet / From morning, / Crossing the river.[^fn4-13]

[^fn4-13]: From Blyth, R. H. _Haiku. Volume I: Eastern Culture_. Paperback edition. Tokyo: Hokuseido Press, 1981, p. 127.

Notice that the verses tell a story in pairs (Kyorai’s and Bashō’s; Bashō’s and Bonchō’s) but not all together. Put together, Kyorai’s verse and Bashō’s verse paint a coherent picture of the first winter rain drizzling down on the soggy leaves that stir noiselessly. Bashō’s and Bonchō’s tell a story in which one’s breeches are wet from crossing the river on a gusty morning. In the second story, it cannot be raining or else one’s coat would be soaked as well, hence the second story actively contradicts the first.

As we see, linked verse vividly demonstrates the importance of context to the object. No verse by itself has a particular meaning. Rather, its meaning depends crucially on what comes before and after it. On the other hand, linked verse also shows the way that such contextually dependent objects can begin to possess a life of their own which we ecstatically inhabit. In spite of the kaleidoscopic recontextualization of the particular verses, over the course of the linked verse sequence as a whole, a unity pervades.  As Watsuji writes in _Milieu_, 

> In linked verse, each verse has its own independent world, and yet between them there is a subtle *connection*, so that one world expands into another, and it possesses an arrangement as a totality. (WTZ 8:194)

A whole set of linked verses shows the unity of authors as a collective subject while also showing their particular individuality; it shows the unity of the verses while also demonstrating a diversity of topics, seasons, and moods. Blyth comments:

> At all events, we have here a kind of communistic poetry, and in it we may see the poetic life being lived by four old Japanese poets, both individually and in communion. Part of its worth lies precisely where we cannot grasp it, in the overlapping, in the interpenetration of one scene with another, of man with nature. […] Every haiku […] has a kind of fluidity which is different from vagueness. This fluidity makes it less static, less circumscribed; we see things in their manifold relations, at the same time as we see them as solitary objects. (138)

This double vision of the co-arising suchness of persons and objects is precisely what has been posited in this chapter as the heart of aesthetic vision. How is this possible? Watsuji asks,

> And yet how is “randomness” able to create an artistic unity? Here as well the answer is the coming together of spirits, albeit spirits with personality. The excellent arrangement of linked verse cannot be had without the coming together of the spirits of all the participants. While leaving their individual particularity intact, they bring their spirits together in their creation and express the lived experience of each in the echoing reverberation of each other’s hearts. (WTZ 8:194)

The three verses given above are clearly telling two different stories, but unlike the Surrealist “exquisite corpse” parlor game, we do not get the sense of sheer nihilistic randomness from the careening shifts of the verses. It is the coming together of spirits which draws the verses together. The aesthetic judgment of the participants clearly requires a certain frame of mind which can unite them in spite of their differences, and that this frame of mind can exist at all reveals to us the twofold nature of the human subject as both individual and collective. When the participants achieve the coming together of spirits, a greater whole is created out of which aesthetic judgment comes to have a normative force. Because the human being is both individual and collective, linked verse is able to show the personality of its many collaborators both individually and collectively without having to eliminate one for the sake of the other. The structure of a linked verse meeting provides the authors with detachment from their ordinary concerns but their appreciation for their mutually crafted verses allows them to express their hearts openly in an “echoing reverberation” of merging perspectives.

####Linked verse and aesthetic authority
One incident in the life of Bashō illustrates a key aspect of aesthetic judgment. Blyth relates a dispute that arose about the proper interpretation of a poem by Bashō’s disciple Kyorai. The poem is:

> [岩鼻や / ここにもひとり / 月の客][ja] <br/>
> <br/>
> _Iwa hana ya / koko nimo hitori / tsuki no kyaku_<br/>
> <br/>
> On the edge of this rock, / Here is one more / Moon-viewer. (343)

Blyth translates from _Kyorai Shō_ [去来抄][ja] (_Records of Kyorai_):

> Kyorai said, “Shadō asserted that this must be a monkey, but what I intend is another person.” Bashō retorted, “A monkey! What does he mean? What were you thinking when you composed the poem?” Kyorai answered, “As I was walking over the fields and mountains, singing under the light of the full moon, I found, on the edge of a rock, another man filled with poetical excitement.” Bashō said, “In the phrase, ‘There is one more person,’ you announce yourself; in this there is poetry.” […] My poetical taste is below the highest, but in Bashō’s interpretation, there is something fantastic, I think. (343)

About this incident, Blyth remarks, “we have here the entertaining picture of Bashō telling Kyorai, not what he ought to have said, but what he ought to have meant by what he said” (343). Why is Bashō’s interpretation preferred over Kyorai’s? What is the source of his authority? Ought not Kyorai as the author of the poem have a deeper insight into its authentic meaning? As the teacher of Kyorai, Bashō is in a position to offer an authoritative interpretation of Kyorai’s work. Through a lifetime of training, Bashō has made himself able to instantly size up the merits of a haiku. He is able to speak for the poetic betweenness in which they both operate. At the same time, one of the reasons that it is Bashō and not someone else (for example, Shadō) who is in that position is that Kyorai as the author had always intended for the poem to be evaluated by someone with the degree of insight that he considered his master to have. Kyorai trusts Bashō’s taste. Thus, as an author, Kyorai has the authority to invest Bashō with a claim to the authoritative interpretation. Bashō may be called an “ideal observer” or “suitable spectator” for the poem because he has cultivated his taste to its utmost. But notice that the judgment that Bashō achieved came not through passive observation or spectating but through a lifetime of embodied engagement in the poetic arts. Thus, it is better to describe Bashō as an “authoritative agent” rather than an “ideal observer.” The connoisseur must be in some sense an accomplished creator (even if only a creator of criticism) who enacts their artistry as an expression of the betweenness out of which the artistic community emerges.

Notice also Bashō’s interpretation of the poem: “In the phrase, ‘There is one more person,’ you announce yourself” (343). The experience of this verse also fits within the structure of detachment and ecstasy. “On the edge of this rock” introduces the scene with detachment. From a distance, the poet is observing a far off mountain peak. Then the poet writes, “There is one more.” If we remained in a detached perspective, this would merely introduce another object of contemplation. But as Bashō recognizes, the detached perspective must now gain greater depth through its reflexivity. There is one more on the mountain, and I am on the mountain. This leads inexorably to the moment of aesthetic experience in which the difference between the poet’s self and the other on the peak are given union in a broader context: they are all moon-viewers, even the edge of the rock. In the moment of the aesthetic judgment, the subject moves ecstatically to see itself as just another moon-viewer. The normative authority to speak for that subject is invested by the aesthetic community in one who has cultivated the ability actively crystalize such moments.

####Poetic truth in linked verse
One of the central considerations in this debate and one of the central considerations for any poet in that period of Japanese history was a poem’s connection to the _hon’i_ ([本意][ja]) or “root implications” of the situation versus merely private implications (_shii_ [私意][ja]). [Kōji][sc] Kawamoto explains in _The Poetics of Japanese Verse_ that certain poetic images had, in the course of Japanese literary history, developed certain fixed associations. For example, the autumn dusk is forlorn, hence this verse by Bashō:

> [この道や / 行く人なしに / 秋のくれ][ja]<br/>
> <br/>
> _Kono michi ya / yuku hito nashi ni / aki no kure_<br/>
> <br/>
> Autumn dusk / on this path /without a traveller.[^fn4-14]

[^fn4-14]: My translation here and below.

In this verse, Bashō is doing several things simultaneously. Concretely, he observes the lonesome emptiness of the road he walks. Abstractly, he complains that few follow the Way or Dao [道][zh] to which he has dedicated his life. Literarily, he connects himself into a long tradition of poetry about the lonesomeness of the evening in autumn. The overall effect of the verse comes from the interpenetration of these aspects in a single moment of time. 

Yosa Buson ([與謝 蕪村][ja], 1716--1783) continued the poetic tradition of forlorn dusks but tweaks it a bit:

> [さびしさの / うれしくもあり / 秋の暮れ][ja]<br />
> <br />
> *Sabishisa no / ureshiku mo ari / aki no kure*<br />
> <br />
> The loneliness of / the autumn dusk / also has its joys.

Hence we see that the aesthetic community of the linked verse or haiku poets advanced into novel harmonies by proposing *hon’i* and then subjecting these aesthetic judgments to further exploration and refinement through the interpenetration of personal experience and literary allusion. Kawamoto explains, 

>_Hon’i_ is usually explained as the essential qualities inherent in an object and the emotional response deemed appropriate. However, […] the actual qualities of the phenomenon itself were second to the conceptual qualities acquired through literary precedent. To give a twist to Oscar Wilde’s famous remark […], there may have been autumn dusks for centuries in Japan, but no one saw them until the age of the _Shinkokinshū_ (ca. 1210), when the theme of autumn evening began to attract markedly strong interest.[^fn4-15]

[^fn4-15]: Kawamoto, p. 61. Oscar Wilde’s famous remark is “There may have been fogs for centuries in London. I dare say there were. But no one saw them, and so we do not know anything about them. They did not exist till Art had invented them” (Kawamoto 10).

For Bashō and the other Japanese poets, the aim of poetry is the kind of naturalness that arises when things are able to express themselves as they are, including emotionally. Hattori Dohō ([服部 土芳][ja], 1657--1730), one of Bashō’s students, records one of his teachings in _Sanzōshi_ [三冊子][ja]: 

> “Learn of the pine from the pine; learn of the bamboo from the bamboo.” These words of our Master mean to distance oneself from private implications ([私意][ja] _shii_). Learning that leaves one as one is is not in the end learning. He says learn because what makes a verse is entering into things and feeling the delicate emotions that appear. For example, 
even if you put into words that something is, should there be no feeling coming from the thing itself naturally, the thing and the *I* will remain two, and sincere truth of feeling will not be achieved. It will be an idea constructed from one’s private implications.[^fn4-16] 

[^fn4-16]: My translation. In Nose, Asaji. *Sanzōshi hyōshaku* (Tokyo: Meicho Kankōkai, 1970), pp. 97--98. Cf. Kawamoto, p. 64.

In other words, when Bashō writes emotionally charged poems about the world, he takes it that these poems are not drawing from any private or subjective emotional associations with things in the world (_shii_), but from a proper understanding of the emotionality embedded in the world as a matrix of natural and social co-construction (_hon’i_). The _hon’i_ come from putting the self into the object and letting the object express its own feeling of fullness naturally. Kawamoto notes that _hon’i_ are difficult to categorize using traditional Western schemes of classification since they are neither clearly subjective nor clearly objective. Kawamoto explains that while _hon’i_ are in one sense merely connotative, nevertheless,

> it is not a subjective meaning dependent on each individual speaker or listener. Rather, as a conventional association, it has gained the objectivity and legitimacy of something normative. (4)

From the perspective of this chapter, we might say on the other hand that _hon’i_ are something subjective, but they are not “subjective” as individual impulses, but as the normative aesthetic judgments of a collectively embodied subjectivity which arises out of nothing and tries to position itself in such a way as to gain the authority to speak for the emptiness at the heart of things. Hence in the previous quotation from _Sanzōshi_, according to Kawamoto,

> Bashō is saying that poetic truth can only be achieved through a sympathetic and selfless faith in the traditions of the past. As the boundary between the one who sees and the object seen grows weak, the two are fused, and the division into subject and object becomes meaningless. (65)

_Hon’i_ are difficult to classify as objective or subjective exactly because of the brittleness of those categories as they have been traditionally understood. _Hon’i_ are what one _should_ feel in a given situation. Indeed, the Japanese poets would insist that a fact about the autumn sunset was revealed when it came to be associated with a sense of forlornness, and a fact about the passing spring was revealed when they came to associate it with the calling birds. These associations are just as normative as the causal associations that force us to think of the second billiard ball rolling away when see the first about to impact it. In the case of Japanese literature, it is just that the object of association is emotional rather than physical. Nevertheless, in spite of the emotionality and subjectivity of these associations, they are not merely idiosyncratic they are a way of entering into and showing the sincere truth of things.

Another example of _hon’i_ of things comes from Bashō’s _The Narrow Path to the Interior_ (_Oku no Hosomichi_ [奥の細道][ja], 1702):

> [行春や / 鳥啼魚の / 目は泪][ja]<br/>
> <br/>
> _Yuku haru ya / tori naki uo no / me wa namida_<br/>
> <br/>
> Passing spring: / the birds cry and the fish / have eyes full of tears.

Formally speaking, the poem consists of two parts divided by the cutting word _ya_. In the first, the poet invokes the passing spring. Earlier Japanese poets had created an association between grief over the changing of the seasons and the crying of birds (Kawamoto 84--5).  One source of this association is the poem “Spring Prospects” (_Chun Wang_ [春望][zh]) by Du Fu ([杜甫][zh], 712--770), which reads, in part: 

> [國破山河在，城春草木深。感時花濺淚，恨別鳥驚心。][zh]<br />
> <br />
> The nation shattered, mountains and rivers remain;<br />
> city in spring, grass and trees burgeoning.<br />
> Feeling the times, blossoms draw tears;<br />
> hating separation, birds alarm the heart.[^fn4-17]

[^fn4-17]: Translation form Watson, p. 30. 

Here we can see the core elements that Bashō’s poem has refashioned to capture his experience: spring, tears, separation, and birds. The only missing element are the fish. In general, Bashō’s writing often skillfully refashioned ancient Chinese and Japanese sources to give them a personal twist.

In the second part of the poem, we are given a concrete image of spring’s passing that relies on this association. In Japanese, both the singing of birds and the mourning of humans are called _naki_ (crying), and Bashō has played up this ambiguity by writing _naki_ with the character [啼][ja], which can have either meaning, rather than using 泣, which specifically means mourning, or [鳴][ja], which specifically means birdsong. Within the narrative context of _The Narrow Path to the Interior_, we form a mental picture of Bashō as he and his disciple leave to begin their long journey. Bashō explains: “I set out after composing this verse, the first of my journey, but I could barely keeping going ahead, for when I looked back I saw my friends standing in a row, no doubt to watch until we were lost to sight.”[^fn4-18]

[^fn4-18]: Translation here is from Keene, p. 23.

Reading this, some critics might suggest that the concreteness of the poem’s imagery is undercut by Bashō’s strong emotional response. As Japanese literature critic Haruo Shirane notes in _Traces of Dreams_, the birds and fish seem to “mourn the passing of the spring, and by implication the departure of the traveler” (247). Yet, a critic might claim, this is surely impossible for birds and fish. Moreover, some commentators take the poem as perhaps representing travelers by the passing spring or allegorically identifying the disciples left behind with the fish and the departing Bashō and Sora with the birds (Shirane 247). Other scholars interpret the image of the fish’s tears more literally by seeing them as beads of water on fish in a fishmonger’s shop (Kawamoto 85). In any event, for Bashō to simply anthropomorphically project his own grief onto the world around him would be an instance of the pathetic fallacy and a betrayal of the ideals of _hon’i_. When we interpret Bashō’s poem from the perspective of the _hon’i_, we see that he is not projecting his own sorrow onto the birds and fish, but to the contrary, because of his immersion in his native poetic tradition, he is able to see the resonance between his individual grief and the larger grief which arises out of the situation itself. It was his own grief at leaving that provided a gateway for Bashō to step through and feel correctly the pathos inherent to the situation. The grief was already in the birds and fish, but it was only at that very moment that his own perspective allowed him to see their grief. Just as one can only see the beauty of the sunrise if some stimulus wakes one up early in the morning, in order to understand the passing of the spring, Bashō had to find himself in a context in which his grief acted as a stimulus that awoke him to the deeper grief of the passing of spring. His own grief is what awoke him, but what he saw once awake was something outside of himself: the fullness of the object as he and it arise from emptiness.
