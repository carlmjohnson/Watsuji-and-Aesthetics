##Chapter 4. The Subject of Aesthetic Judgment

####Contents:
<toc />

###From my feelings to our judgments
How do I form my aesthetic judgments as an individual, and how could I ever share my personal, internal, individual aesthetic judgments with any else? Why should I as an individual come to feel compelled in my aesthetic preferences by the preferences of others? What is the source aesthetic agreement? How is it that there are such things as communities of taste? How can deference to such preferences of others possibly be an authentic expression of my subjectivity? Is there anything like normativity in aesthetic judgment or can we only describe our aesthetic feelings without prescribing them?

In the last chapter, we attempted to restore aesthetic experience by focusing how it is felt in everyday experience, where the subject and object are not cleanly distinguished but instead the subject experiences the ecstatic intoxication of seeing things from the perspective of the object. I, the subject, experience an object and judge it to be beautiful or ugly, lovely or disgusting, sublime or mundane. We saw in the last chapter that the experience in which this takes place is one of dynamic distancing, dissolution, and disinterested enjoyment, but what is it about this experience that renders it a positive basis for judgment? To answer this and the questions given above we must in this chapter go beyond just the surface experience of aesthetics as _kansei_ [感性][ja] or sensibility towards an understanding of aesthetics as _bigaku_ [美学][ja]---the study of beauty and our judgments about it. Because aesthetic judgment is a form of judgment, it can only be made within the context of a cleanly separated subject and object, and this calls for the second step in the hermeneutic methodology outlined in the second chapter, namely construction. We create a subject to look at the object from outside and evaluate it. Accordingly, in this chapter we will need to look more closely at the nature of subject and the nature of the object before we can satisfactorily explain the source of aesthetic judgment and our methods for carrying this judgment out. Finally, we will look at examples from _renga_ ([連歌][ja], Japanese linked verse) that illustrate our contentions about the nature of the self and judgment.



###Who is the subject?
####Subject as agent
As mentioned previously, Naoki Sakai is critical of what he feels is Watsuji’s project of “reducing” the subject to a twofold structure of individual and community as _ningen_. While I feel that Sakai’s criticisms are somewhat wide of the mark, he does do a service for readers who are primarily familiar with Watsuji in translation. In _Return to the West/Return to the East_, he notes that the word “subject” has many renderings in Japanese:

> _Shutai_ [[主体][ja]] was introduced into Japanese intellectual vocabulary as a neologism, as one of the translations for “subject,” _sujet_, or _Subjekt_, other translations being _shugo_ [[主語][ja]] (propositional subject), _shukan_ [[主観][ja]] (epistemic subject), _shudai_ [[主題][ja]] (thematic subject), _shinmin_ [[臣民][ja]] (subject of the emperor), among others. (119)

While most of these ambiguities are fairly clear even to readers whose primary language is English (the subject of a sentence is plainly a different thing than the subject of a king), those who read Watsuji only in translation are apt to miss the distinction he makes between _shutai_ [主体][ja] and _shukan_ [主観][ja]. In both words, the _shu_ [主][ja] represents the host or ruler as opposed to a “guest” (_kyaku_ [客][ja] from which comes “objectivity,” _kyakkansei_ [客観性][ja]). The _kan_ of _shukan_ means to look or to observe, hence _shukan_ indicates the subject as one who passive receives sense data. The _tai_ of _shutai_, on the other hand, means body, hence _shutai_ indicates the subject as embodied agent who is a practical and active.[^] When translating Western works on the nature of the subject into Japanese, those works which consider the subject to be ultimately a transcendental observer tend to be translated using _shukan_, but those under the influence from Marx, Nietzsche, and other sources in which the subject is as the agent of action are translated using _shutai_. For our purposes, the critical aspect of _shutai_ is that it shows the importance of the living body as the ground of the human being. This aspect was especially brought out by the theory of active intuition described by Watsuji’s predecessor and colleague [Nishida][sc] Kitarō.[^]

[^]: The character for _tai_ in _shutai_ was written as [體][zh] in the pre-war orthography, which reflects the close connection between the physical body and Confucian _li_ [禮][zh] (ritual propriety). That the post-war way of writing _tai_ as [体][zh] existed as variant also reflects the view that the body is the root ([本][zh]) of the person ([人][zh]).

[^]: Sakai p. 213 n.4 notes that the interest in _shutai_ by Watsuji and others can be traced to Nishida, especially _Nishida Kitarō Zenshū_ 6:341--427.

For Watsuji, seeing the subject as “’one who observes objects,’ that is, the _shukan_” leads to philosophical difficulties in ethics because “the problem of human existence, the problem of linkages of conduct and practice have no connection to the aforementioned isolated _shukan_” (WTZ 10:11). While the view of the subject as observer has its place---certainly theorizing is a part of human existence---it is a *[déformation professionnelle][fr]* to so valorize the arm chair that we give it priority over practical action in our understanding of human existence. As mentioned in chapter, a common thread in East Asian thought is Wang Yang-Ming’s slogan _zhi xing he yi_ [知行合一][zh], “Unity of knowledge and practice,” and it because of his familiarity with this culture of thought that Watsuji is critical of that strain of Cartesian thinking in which one sits in one’s study and attempts to prove the existence of the other. As he explains in _Study of Ethics_, the attempt shows its own superfluousness in the writing:

> _Writing_ “only the _I_ is a certainty” is a self-contradiction because writing is the expression of words using letters and words are something that develop only in the possession of a partner to live with and speak with.  (WTZ 10:52)

We forget that there’s no one out there who could read our disproof of solipsism without already disbelieving in solipsism because we neglect the importance of the body and its practical conduct in favor of a view of the subject as observer. In aesthetics as well as ethics, we must be careful not to elevate the observing subject over the agentive subject if we are to escape certain pitfalls of thought.

One approach to talking about norms in aesthetic judgment has been to couch claims about what constitutes good and bad taste in terms of the reactions of a hypothetical “suitable spectator” or an “ideal observer.” In this framework, taste is that judgment posed by an ideal observer and when faced with the question of rendering a judgment about a particular aesthetic object or event, the correct judgment to render is one that agrees with that of the ideal observer. Richard Wollheim, for example, claims in “On Pictorial Representation” that we can judge the success of representation in a picture on the basis of whether, “if a suitable spectator looks at the picture, he will, other things equal, have the appropriate experience” (396). However, from the perspective on the subject just mentioned it is clear that rather than thinking in terms of an ideal _observer_ or suitable _spectator_ (_shukan_), we should think in terms of ideal _embodied agents_ or appropriate _actors_ (_shutai_).

What this means is that it is not enough for us to think of aesthetics only from the point of view of a passive aesthetic experience as was done in the last chapter. While such a perspective is important to understand, we also need to see that this perspective is itself an embodied activity undertaken by the subject. We not only stumble into beauty, but we actively seek it out as artists and as audiences. We prepare our minds to receive beauty by undertaking actions which open us to the possibility of disinterested enjoyment. The physical activity of walking to the theater or signing one’s name in the guestbook at the gallery should not be overlooked when analyzing the aesthetic experience, because these activities allow our bodies to help physically prepare the mindset of distancing and dissolution which will be needed. Even more so in aesthetic judgment, it is important to remember that the form of judgment which we exercise most is practical rather than theoretical. Because our perception is aspectival, the practical judgments we make about the world around us are already built into everyday experience in its most basic form. We judge that the chair is for sitting and the body we see in the distance is a friend with whom we share a relationship. To be a “suitable spectator” for forming an aesthetic judgment therefore requires not only that we take up a certain cognitive stance, but that also that we engage in certain behaviors and activities that will both cultivate and demonstrate our suitability.[^]

[^]: Space restrictions do not permit the elaboration of the parallel here, but attentive readers will note the similarity between this and Wittgenstein’s remarks concerning the importance of our “forms of life” to understanding one another. “If a lion could talk, we could not understand him” (*Philosophical Investigations*, p. 190). “What has to be accepted, the given, is---so one could say---_forms of life_” (p. 192).


§Importance of imaginative production
####Subject as plural
Thinking of the subject of aesthetic as _shutai_---actively embodied---rather than _shukan_---passively contemplating---leads us to another aspect of the subject. As previously explained, a human being as subject is constantly engaged in a dialectical movement of double negation between the individual and social moments of existence in our persistent relationships. Accordingly, it is misleading to think of the subject of aesthetic judgment as a purely individual. In an earlier work, _Fūdo_ [風土][ja] or _Milieu_, Watsuji explained that

> our insight is that the physical body (_nikutai_ [肉体][ja]) is not simply a “material thing” (_buttai_ [物体][ja]); i.e., the subjectivity (_shutaisei_ [主体性][ja]) of the physical body. However, to the extent that we are limited by traditional *[Anthropologie][de]*, we deal only with the study of individual persons (_hito_ [人][ja]) and not the study of humanity (_ningen_ [人間][ja]). (WTZ 8:17)

Treating the mind and body non-dualistically in terms of an embodied subject requires that we go beyond the study of individual persons to look at how persons come together to form communities. This is because,

> The subjectivity (_shutaisei_ [主体性][ja]) of the physical body depends on the spatiotemporal structure of human existence as its ground. It follows that a subjective physical body is not an isolated physical body. A subjective physical body has a dynamic structure as though it were combining while isolated and isolated in being combined. (WTZ 8:17)

While our individual subjectivities are an important aspect of aesthetic judgment, so too are our social subjectivities. To paint a full picture of aesthetic judgment, we must see how both are constructed. The basis of this construction is precisely, as was just described, that we are actively embodied subjects in addition to being passively contemplating subjects. From the perspective of the passively contemplating subject, the problem of solipsism looms large, but as we saw, the actively embodied subject dissolves the problem of solipsism just by writing about it. 

In chapter two, we looked at this quotation from Watsuji’s _Study of Ethics_:

> It cannot be that the consciousness of I who feel the beauty of a picture and the consciousness of Thou towards the same picture are completely independent things. We are feeling the same beauty together. The difference in the way that two people feel can only be compared on the ground of this shared feeling. (WTZ 10:76)

According to conventional philosophical anthropologies, my feelings are mine and therefore completely private. This leads, as we have seen, to a crisis about how shared taste can even be possible. Watsuji’s anthropology, however, denies the presupposition that the individual self is atomic and substantive. As a result, we should not be surprised to see Watsuji arguing that “the interpenetration of the consciousnesses of self and other is especially prominent in its emotional aspect” (WTZ 10:74) because,

> In situations where the persistent relationship (_aidagara_ [間柄][ja]) of self and other is extremely intimate and the communal existence is acutely realized, the _I_ shares an identical emotion with the other. (WTZ 10:74)

Because the subject is not only individual but also communal, feelings can arise in the subject as communal then be shared by subjects as individuals and vice versa. In certain circumstances, these feelings are not just similar but the same. Watsuji gives the example of parents who lose a child. The sorrow they feel is not just similar, “the sorrow is for the parents a communal sorrow, thus they feel an *identical* sorrow together” (WTZ 10:74). Because the source of the sorrow is the shared in common, it is right to call it an identical emotion.

Such sharing of intense feelings is what makes comparing aesthetic judgments and the subsequent creation of canons of taste in the art world possible. That such canons exist is an observable fact of everyday experience, so it is conventional anthropology that needs to be on the defensive here, since conventional anthropology renders these canons difficult to explain. However, what about the inverse phenomena? We not only observe that canons of taste are created, we also observe that sometimes canons of taste fail to come together and no particular canon of taste can claim universal assent. As the ancient saying has it, *[de gustibus non disputandum est][la]*. However, unlike a purely collectivist anthropology, the Watsujian anthropology employed here also has a clear answer for why this is so. In the incessant movement of double negation, the communal moment in human existence is matched by a moment individuation.

One clear illustration of the process by which communities of aesthetic taste emerge is gustatory taste. Watsuji writes,

> we *divide* food to taste it. The taste is on the tongue of each person. But can those tastes be *separate tastes*? In the case of dividing and tasting some sugar, do we not taste *an identical sweetness*? Should one person feel the sugar to be bitter, we will immediately treat that person as sick. That is, we will handle it as a case of one being temporarily deprived of the ability to taste an identical sweetness. […] If bodily sensation were something that separated people from each other, such things could not be. (WTZ 10:80)

We will return to the example of physical taste in the next chapter when we look at the more closely contextual background out of which our judgments of taste arise, but for now suffice it to say that aesthetic judgment always takes place within a social and ethical context. In the aesthetic experience of tasting delicious food, for instance, one nearly loses oneself in rapture to the flavorful sensation of the dish. However, this experience of partial self-dissolution is always made possible first by specific cultural structures. Before we can experience a meeting of subject-object, there must be a coming together of individuals as a collective subject in a society. Hence our understanding of the subject of aesthetic experience can never be limited to an appreciation for the individual’s experience alone, but we must also appreciate the ways in which the communal whole enjoys the aesthetic experience as a subject. As Watsuji writes,

> The discrimination between approval and disapproval is itself from the first both individual and social, and it cannot be understood from outside the structure of human existence. (WTZ 10:135)

§This big subject v. little subject contrast is more important than the usual subject-object contrast

###What is an object?
Having looked again at the subject, we must also look again at the object. In the last chapter, we suggest that an object is that which objects. Another way to look at the question is suggested by the Japanese word _sonzai_ [存在][ja], which means “to exist” or “to be.” A. C. Graham notes in “ ‘Being’ in Western Philosophy Compared With *Shih/Fei* and *Yu/Wu* in Chinese Philosophy” that there has been a persistent tendency in Western philosophy to conflate the existential and predicative senses of “to be.” This tendency is not seen in Chinese thought, and fallacies which rest on such an equivocation are difficult to translate into classical Chinese. As Watsuji notes, Japanese also distinguishes sharply between the existential verb (subject _ga aru_) and the predicative copula (subject predicate _dearu_). _Sonzai_ is for the most part equivalent to _ga aru_ just as the English “exist” is equivalent to “there is.” The value of _sonzai_ for Japanese philosophy is that because it cannot be used to say that “_A_ is _B_,” the grammar of the language makes it clear for a thing to exist is not the same as it having certain predicates. This helps overcome the tendency towards essentialism and eternalism in Western thinking. For a certain thing to “exist” need not require that the thing maintain certain properties. As with Watsuji’s theory of anthropology, to be can be a dynamic interplay of negation and double negation rather than the maintenance of a simple static essence.

In his _Study of Ethics_, Watsuji further looks at the word _sonzai_ in terms of its component characters [存][zh] (modern standard Mandarin _cun_) and [在][zh] (also _zai_). In Chinese, where the compound was first used, _cun_ meant to protect against loss and _zai_ meant to be or remain in a particular place, hence as a compound _sonzai_ suggests preservation over time and persistence in space (WTZ 10:24). Where the various Western terms for “being” suggest that to continue to exist is the default state of things, _sonzai_ suggests that objects may only attempt to resist the impermanence of things temporarily. An object, therefore, exists in a certain place for a certain time in contradistinction to the background of the environment in which it arises. The object works to perpetuate itself while it can but eventually fails and is lost in the flow of time.

On top of this, Watsuji further claims that our understanding of _sonzai_ must be in terms of _human_ existence, even when we speak of the existence of objects. For an object to exist is for it to exist in a certain place for a certain time, but if, as Watsuji argues with Kant and Heidegger, time and space are parts of the structure of human beings, then the existence object itself has to be understood in terms of its relation to the human subject: 

> If, as we said before, _son_ is the self-holding of the subject (_shutai_) and _zai_ is being within human relations, then “existence” (_sonzai_) is simply the self-holding of the subject as a persistent relationship (_aidagara_).  We may moreover say simply that “existence” is “the linkage of human conduct.” Thus, in the strictest sense, existence is merely “human existence.” The existence of a thing is no more than an anthropomorphic way of speaking about “the being of a thing” (_mono no yuu_) which springs from human existence. (WTZ 10:25)

Watsuji’s _Milieu_ provides another way of thinking about the nature of the object through a vivid example of the way that our subjective judgments are embodied and shared. Think of standing outside in the cold with an acquaintance. What will you say? Almost certainly, “Whew, sure is cold, huh?” When you say this is the cold that you are feeling the _same_ as the cold that your acquaintance feels? Modern Western philosophers tended to treat the feeling of heat or coolness in objects as a secondary quality rather than a primary quality, which means that for them you are _not_ feeling the same cold. You feel only your own cold in your own mind, and on the basis of this feeling infer a similar feeling may exist within the mind of your acquaintance. However, since you have never been your acquaintance, it is not clear how well rationally grounded this inferential process could be. Watsuji sidesteps this difficulty by affirming what common sense tells us, namely that the cold I feel is the same cold that you feel:

> just as there is no obstacle to our saying, “*we* feel the cold,” it is we who bodily experience the cold and not just the *I*. *We feel the cold communally*. It is just because of this that we use a word that expresses this cold with one another as *an everyday greeting*. Even if amongst us the way of feeling of cold is different from person to person, this is possible on the ground of feeling the cold communally. Without this ground, knowledge of the bodily experience of cold in another *I* would be utterly impossible. (WTZ 8:10)

The basis of Watsuji’s conclusion here is that,

> An intentional object is not some kind of psychological content. It follows that coldness as the bodily experience of an independently existing objective cold air could not be the intentional object. When we *feel* the cold, we do not feel the “sensation” of cold, rather we directly *feel* the chill of the outside air, that is, the cold air. In other words, cold as “the thing felt” in intentional bodily experience is not “something subjective” (_shukan-teki na mono_ [主観的なもの][ja]) but “something objective.” Therefore, we may say that the intentional “relation” in itself of *feeling* the cold is already related to the chilliness of the outside air. (WTZ 8:9)

The cold that we feel is an object which we feel inside yet at the same time it is an object which we find ourselves out in the midst of:

> When the cold is first discovered, we ourselves are already out in the cold. Therefore, that which is most primordially “being outside” is not a thing or object like the cold air, but we ourselves. “Going outside” is a fundamental prescript of our own structure, and intentionality as well is founded on nothing else. (WTZ 8:10)

Following Heidegger, Watsuji calls this state of existence in the world as a form of standing outside of oneself “ex-sistere.” This going outside of oneself is the basis of space and time, which are parts of the structure of human existence. Hence when we see an object in the world, we are at once seeing something foreign to ourselves---an object which is objecting---but also something that is a part of us. The object exists in a space at a time, and that space and time are part of the shared structure of the human subject. To discover the object is to discover the _I_ opposed to the object and to discover the _we_ who gather around the object. 

An extended quote from _Study of Ethics_ is illustrative of Watsuji’s point:

> For example, when we *love* or *think fondly of* a row of ginkgo trees, we are treating the row of trees as a *Thou*. It follows that it is not the case that we first find ourselves surrounded by simple “things” and then infer the subsistence of a special species among those things, that is, one with another *I*, and then finally reach the phase of loving the trees by applying an analogy from my relation to the other *I* to my relation to the trees. When we find the trees, they are already trees with a character given by the ground of human existence, for instance as a row of ginkgo trees. The *we* who finds the row of trees is the *we* who already socially created things like rows of trees and not a *we* which must find these things inferentially. Whatever sort of a thing it is we find, we have already found that object before as a *Thou*. In this sense, the spatiality of the subject (*shutai*) acts as the means of finding objective things. In other words, generally speaking, the first moment in the establishment of an object is when a subject becomes a *Thou* or a *He/She* and opposes the *I*. (WTZ 10:188)

Our aesthetic appreciation of even natural objects like trees is mediated through the conceptual apparatus we possess as human beings in a community, and it is out of our communal humanity that these things emerge as potential objects of appreciation. 

If this is the case, can Watsuji be said to be a realist about the object? Is his object just an idealist’s figment of the imagination? Is Watsuji’s account of existence so anthropocentric that it drains the outside world of its reality? I will argue that in spite of the superficial appeal of these accusations, Watsuji is still a realist at heart. In “I Touch What I Saw,” Arindam Chakrabarti provides four tests for whether one is a realist about an apple:

> (A) The apple is distinct from just an experience or idea of an apple.<br />
> (B)  The apple is distinct from just its red-color, its coldish touch, smooth texture and sweet taste, and also from just a series or set of these qualities. <br />
> \(C)  The apple that I now touch (or bite or smell) is the same as the apple that I saw a while ago. <br />
> (D)  The apple that I see is the same as the apple that you see. (105--6)

(A) must be true if Watsuji’s phenomenological account of ex-sistere is correct.  An apple is distinct from the experience of an apple, because the apple is a thing outside of the mind that is intended in the experience of the apple. (B) must be true if the distinction between the existential and predicative use of “being” that we have been making is correct. For X to be an apple is not the same as saying that an apple is, so the apple is more than just a collection of predicates. \(C) follows from the _son_ aspect of _sonzai_: existence is a preservation against loss spread out over time. As for (D), it follows directly from our discussion of the subject as plural. You and I share a world, and on occasion we even share communal feelings. Of course, we may also share objects.

Nevertheless, it would be too quick to say that Watsuji is a straightforward realist, whether about subjects or objects. Rather, as a Buddhist, he gives an account that attempts to steer a “Middle Way” between realism and nihilism, and this leads us to affirm the existence of objects on the conventional level while denying their substantiality on the ultimate level and positing emptiness as the source of the creative impermanence of things.

Returning then to the question of aesthetics, what is the object of aesthetic judgment? The object, as we have seen, emerges from the active, plural subject understood as the space of persistent relationships, but it also stands outside of the subject drawing the subject away from itself. There is a delicate interplay to be had. Should the subject stay where it is and refuse ex-sistere, there can be no object, but on the other hand, should the subject expand too far, it will swallow the object up and there will be no ex-sistere because the self has merely come into itself. Accordingly, we must firmly emphasize the dynamic, dialectical nature of the movement of double negation. As the term _sonzai_ implies, the subject-object complex has its existence as a temporary swelling in an ocean of impermanence. For a moment these waves roil through a field of relations, but always with the danger that a wave that grows too large becomes nothing more than the surface of the sea. What connects subjects and objects is that both spring from and return to emptiness itself. As we shall shortly see, understanding this is the key to understanding the basis of understanding aesthetic judgment and the appreciation of the object.

###The attitude of the critic
§samsara is really nirvana; heijou sin kore ze miti

To understand judgment as our assessment of the harmony of aesthetic experience in greater depth, it is worth looking more closely at the attitude of the critic. The communicability of aesthetic judgments requires that we argue that “this will be seen as beautiful should one approach it in a suitable manner,” but what is that manner?

One approach to criticism is to be critical, that is, to criticize. One can search the object closely for faults in order to seize on them and present them to its creator and others. This attitude, however, is clearly of more use in fostering one’s reputation among fellow connoisseurs than it is for allowing one to aesthetically engage with the object. It has its place, but it is not strictly aesthetic. 

In a short essay entitled “Art Criticism” (_Geijutsu Hihyō_ [芸術批評][ja]), Watsuji explains his approach and the approach of Jean-Marie Guyau (1854--1888) to criticism. Both are opposed to the brand of criticism that seeks only to tear down. Watsuji interprets Guyau’s view as being, “one who we ought to call a critic is one who is best sings praises to the beautiful and also one who is best able to explain this praise to others” (WTZ 8:189). While agreeing with this sentiment, Watsuji feels that we must not lose sight of the source of criticizing criticism either. In his view, “The ideal critic knows best how to praise beauty, while also being at the same time the most sensitive towards the ugly” (WTZ 8:190). When the critic criticizes, it should not be out of a desire to impress others with one’s snobbish sophistication, but out of a sensitivity to the ways that object came so close to achieving greatness but fell short. Understanding the ugliness of the object comes from an understanding of the ideal whose fullness has not yet been realized.

The attitude a critic must possess in order to simultaneously praise the beautiful and criticize the bad is, Watsuji and Guyau agree, love. Love, of course, can be understood in many ways beyond even the traditional Greek distinctions between [ἀγάπη][el] (charitable love), [ἔρως][el] (erotic love), [φιλία][el] (brotherly love), and [στοργή][el] (familial affection). To add in distinctions from the East Asian tradition, we might also mention [慈悲][zh] (Chinese _cibei_, Japanese _jihi_, “compassion”),  [戀][zh] (*lian*, _koi_, “yearning love”), [愛][zh] (_ai_, _ai_, “possessive love”), and [仁][zh] (_ren_, _jin_, “humane conduct”). Each of these concepts of love has a different shade of meaning which has evolved historically and each reveals a different aspect of the attitude needed for aesthetic judgment. The thread that runs through them as concepts is the sense of outward yearning concern. In _Study of Ethics_, Watsuji mentions one view of love given by Hegel in _Philosophy of Right_ (WTZ 10:87). I believe Hegel captures something of commonality of our conceptions of love:

> Love is in general the consciousness of the unity of myself with another. I am not separate and isolated, but win my self-consciousness only by renouncing my independent existence, and by knowing myself as unity of myself with another and of another with me. […] The first element in love is that I will to be no longer an independent self-sufficing person, and that, if I were such a person, I should feel myself lacking and incomplete. The second element is that I gain myself in another person, in whom I am recognized, as he again is in me. Hence love is the most tremendous contradiction, incapable of being solved by the understanding. Nothing is more obstinate than this scrupulosity of self-consciousness, which, though negated, I yet insist upon as something positive. Love is both the source and solution of this contradiction. As a solution it is an ethical union.[^]

[^]: Hegel, _Philosophy of Right_, §158, 

Watsuji summarizes, “love is the contradiction that to abandon oneself is to acquire oneself” (WTZ 10:88). For our purposes, what love must mean is a willingness to go beyond one’s horizons while accepting the otherness of the object. That is, love desires the other without needing to possess it or smother it. The feeling of ecstatic intoxication or disinterested enjoyment rests on just this. 

In Plato’s _Symposium_, Aristophanes tells a myth about the origin of love. Once, human beings were wholes with four arms, four legs, and two faces, but now we have been divided into halves as punishment by the gods. As a result, we spend our lives searching for our lives in search of a lover to complete us, that is, searching for our other halves:

> Why should this be so? It’s because, as I said, we used to be complete wholes in our original nature, and now “Love” is the name for our pursuit of wholeness, for our desire to be complete.[^] 

[^]: *Symposium*, 192e.

The form of love that makes criticism possible is similar in that it too is a drive to unify in cleavage what was originally together without division. In aesthetic judgment, we are not just looking for another person to complete us, but for oneness with the emptiness out of which subject and object co-arise. This return with difference is the foundation of aesthetic goodness and the drive that compels our experiences to evolve in progressively novel forms.

To be sure, an overemphasis on the word “love” as the attitude of the critic can lead to a misunderstanding of what aesthetic judgment calls for. As we said above, the critic must always be ready to criticize the ugliness of the ugly. While this is compatible with a deeper understanding of love, it easily becomes obscured if our concept of love is too shallow. Another way of conceptualizing the attitude needed for aesthetic judgment that may prevent this misunderstanding is as empathy. The word “empathy” was coined as a translation of the German *[Einfühlung][de]* as it was popularized by Theodor Lipps (1851--1914).[^] Watsuji mentions Lipps in his unfinished notes on art theory and wrote about him several times in his early work, _Revival of the Idols_ (_Guzō Saikō_ [偶像再興][ja]).[^] The German *[Einfühlung][de]* and the Greco-English “empathy” are both compounds meaning “in feeling.” The preposition “in” suggest that while outside the thing being empathized with, we nevertheless enter into it ecstatically. We feel from our position as subjects into the the position of the object. In doing so, we achieve a meeting point of feeling with our fellow appreciators, the artist, and---most importantly---the object itself.

###The source of normativity in aesthetic judgment
Now that we have reconsidered the nature of the subject and object of aesthetic judgment and the attitude need for aesthetic criticism, we may begin to dig into the roots of its very possibility. How and why is aesthetic judgment possible? As Watsuji explains in _Study of Ethics_ though there is regional variation in morality---for example, one society may approve of human sacrifice while another condemns it---this does not undermine the universality of the basis of ethics. In all societies what is condemned are actions that undermine the trust basis of that society and what is praised are actions that reinforce the trust basis of that society. 

But if this is the case, how is it that we as individual members of society feel the call of conscience? If these values are being imposed on us from without in order to preserve society, then it is not clear why as individuals we should feel an *inner* impulse towards a morality made to preserve *outer* order. In that case, moral education is a kind of deformation of the person by which the individual is trained to ignore her authentic desires and interests and produce within herself a feeling of subordination to the order outside of her. Could it be that our call of conscience really be the result of a super-ego that is essential alien to us? Watsuji argues no. In the determination of guilt by a court of law, the one who accuses me stands in for society as whole, but in an affliction of conscience, the one who accuses me is the very emptiness at the heart of my self. In spite of the great degree of social determination that undoubtably goes into the formation of conscience, when we truly feel the call of conscience it does not feel to us as something coming from without but it feels as though it was coming from our inmost personality. 

The reason for this should already be clear from our reexamination of the subject. When we understand the subject correctly, we see it as arising out of the negation of the emptiness that stands prior to the individual or the community. As such, the call of conscience does not arise as an external voice speaking for society but as an internal voice speaking for the authentic source of the subject. As we previously quoted Watsuji,

> already existing persistent relationships (*aidagara* [間柄][ja]) […] are *authenticity* as the origin out of which we ultimately come. (WTZ 10:195)

This is a reformulation of existentialist ethics in which authenticity comes from a return to our persistent relationships as the source of our existence, rather than an insistence on the substantiality of the individual.[^]

[^]: For what it’s worth, even in traditional existential ethics, the substantiality of the individual tends to dissolve in the face of some great whole, such as God in Christian existentialism or Nothingness/the Absurd for atheistic existentialism (cf. WTZ 10:85). Watsuji’s innovation is to see that if we insist on the transcendent permeability of the self, there is no equally good reason not to allow for the horizontal permeability of the self.

Watsuji explicitly links his discussion of conscience to Mencius (WTZ 10:318), who coined the term [良心][zh], which evolved eventually into the term _ryōshin_ in Japanese and _liangxin_ in modern standard Mandarin and is used to translate the English word “conscience.” In the Warring States period, there was a debate about whether moral appropriateness ([義][zh] _yi_) was _nei_ [内][zh] (roughly speaking, “internal”) or _wai_ [外][zh] (“external”), part of which is preserved in _Mencius_ 6A. There have been various interpretations of the exact meaning of this distinction, but we may on a loose reading take it that they wanted to know whether morality is in some ways dependent on the dispositions of the individual or if moral normativity can be imposed on the individual from without by completely impersonal formal considerations.[^] For his part, Mencius claims that our sense of the appropriate must be _nei_ even as it responds to conditions in the world. I argue that what Mencius means by this is not that morality is ‘subjective’ in the sense of being determined only by the individual, but that morality is _nei_ in the sense that it originates in our most inner and authentic self even as it is importantly interpenetrated by our relationships with others---in other words, it is subjective in the sense of a _shutai_ [主体][ja] which we have been exploring here.

[^]: Kwong-Loi Shun’s _Mencius and Early Chinese Thought_, pp. 94--112 is a good starting point for this and other debates surrounding the interpretation of the _Mencius_. Shun defends an interpretation “which takes the internality of _yi_ [[義][zh]] to be the claim that one’s recognition of what is _yi_ derives from certain features of the heart/mind” (103--4).

Mencius and his interlocutors agree that one can take  gustatory taste---savoring a roast or wanting a drink of water---as paradigmatic example of _nei_ (_Mencius_ 6A.4 and 6A.5). Mencius points out that these tastes, while paradigmatically internal, are nevertheless respondent to external conditions. On a hot day, I would like a cold drink, but on a cold day, I would like a hot drink. My wanting a particular kind of drink on the basis of these external circumstances cannot be the result of some coercive education in inauthenticity. As we saw above, our tastes are communal and shared although also intimately subjective. 

In *Milieu*, Watsuji puts the issue so:

> It is not the case that human beings first desired either livestock or fish and then chose either stock farming or fishing. Rather, we came to desire either livestock or fish on the basis of stock farming or fishing being climatologically (_fūdo-teki_ [風土的][ja]) determined. In the same way, the determinant of vegetarianism or carnivorism is also not ideology, as it is seen by the vegetarians, but our milieu (_fūdo_ [風土][ja]). So, our appetites do not aim at something like food in general but are directed towards food created in the manner of a specific cuisine which has been prepared since long ago already. What we desire when we are hungry is bread or rice, beefsteak or sashimi, and so on. A form of cuisine expresses a people’s longstanding climatological self-apprehension. (WTZ 8:13)

If our hungers are not authentic---if the desire for food is not _nei_---then there are no authentic desires to be had. In the same way, argues Mencius, our sense of what is appropriate must respond to external circumstances (and should it fail to respond it would be an error, just as it is an error to desire salt water in a desert), but it nevertheless the internality of the sense of appropriateness which gives it jurisdiction with which to compel us. 

In Watsuji’s language, we may state this same idea somewhat differently. Legitimate compulsion of the individual can only arise from the source of the individual, that is, from the subject, but the subjective origin of this compulsion does not mean that it is only a matter of what one particular person feels, since the subject is not only individual. In our everyday experience, it is possible for social structures seemingly outside of the individual such as the family, community, or state to compel the individual, but this does not mean that they can exercise their authority insofar as they are external. They have authority only insofar as they are constitutive of one as a person. Watsuji explains in the *Study of Ethics*, 

> A family or a state is something able as a human ethical totality to demand obedience of individuals, but it is not from the standpoint of the family or state alone that this demand has the right to claim obedience. (WTZ 10:130) 

If it is not as human ethical totalities that these institutions speak authoritatively, on whose behalf are they speaking? Socio-ethical wholes have the authority to compel just to the degree that they speak for the betweenness out which both they and the individual arise. Because the source of the individual and the social whole is the same, the one is on occasion able to speak for the other as the voice of its autonomous subject. This means both that the state is able to compel the citizen to follow its (just) laws and that the citizen is able compel the state to reform its unjust laws. The basis for both forms of compulsion is the mutual dependance of the two: the individual could not be who she is without her state, and the state could not exist without its individuals. At its best, the relationship of the citizen and the state is one of virtuosic mutual contribution. 

We may now apply this understanding of the internality of conscience and morality to the normativity of aesthetic judgment by analogy to fashion. In all known human societies there have been some modes of body adornment considered appropriate and some considered inappropriate. One may choose to wear a uniform or not, but no one living in a society can drop out of the fashion race (though many have tried). Whether one chooses to wear what is considered socially appropriate, or whether one choose rebel against it, or even if one chooses not to reflect much on fashion at all; in any event one is intimately wrapped up in fashion. Fashion is closely tied to our self-identities, and in particular it is closely tied to the cultural construction of gender out of more basic sexual differences, hence written and unwritten sumptuary laws dictate the fashion choices and the internal fashion *sensibilities* of individuals. Fashion is, therefore, a prototypical illustration of what Watsuji calls “the linkages of conduct” (_kōi-teki renkan_ [行為的連関][ja]).

But if the fashion choices we make are imposed on us from outside---and they certainly are, otherwise it would not just so happen that men in the West wear shirts and pants, whereas men in other cultures have worn robes, etc., etc.---then why do we feel as though when I dress I put on clothes that reflect _my_ taste in clothing? Has the outside force of fashion education deformed my authentic sartorial feelings? Has my individual, “subjective” fashion sensibility been trampled by the collective, “objective” tastes of my society?

Watsuji argues to the contrary that fashion is an everyday experience of a kind of communal consciousness:

> The phenomenon of “fashion” shows this kind of communal consciousness in a particularly magnified form. It appears as a further narrowed _common taste_ within forms of food, clothing, and shelter already specified nationally and historically. Even if particular individuals had not been conscious of them as their own authentic tastes at the start, they feel this common taste as their own taste. And then something that departs from this taste is felt to be maybe funny or perhaps ugly. (WTZ 10:79)

In other words, in fashion our aesthetic norms originate outside of the particular individual, but they are nevertheless felt as the subjective tastes of individuals because those individuals are ultimately expressions through negation of the prior betweenness. Society may help shape my taste in fashion, but it is still _my_ taste. At the same time, however, by changing my taste in fashion, it is possible for me to change society’s taste in fashion. The two forms of taste are mutually entailing and are ultimately expressions of the ways in which I as individual am made in part by the fashion of my society and my society is made in part by me.

Hence there is a voice which is able to speak with authority about the kinds of taste experiences we “should” be having when we enter into an aesthetic experience. It is the voice of the society as it expresses itself as the source of the individual. Because this voice is trans-personal, it is possible for us as members of a community to discuss our tastes productively. It is not entirely “subjective” in the sense of being entirely individual-relative. On the other hand, since the voice is also the voice of the inmost source of the individual, this voice is “subjective” in the sense of being a part of the subject and able to, at times, command the assent of the subject. These properties of the voice of aesthetic experience help explain why Kant felt that aesthetic judgment is universal but subjective---aesthetic judgment has a normativity that originates within the individual but extends beyond it---without thereby committing us to an implausibly universal coherence of tastes. The scope of the normativity of aesthetic judgment is only as wide as the subject itself. It extends toward anyone with whom I can have an interactive dialogue but it is not yet already extended towards “any rational being” in the absence of prior engagement with such beings. I share my tastes with those around me in society because those who are around me in society are a part of my subject, and I am a part of theirs. Together we render sentiments of taste normative as an expression of our interactions.

What about the other side of aesthetic judgment? Can the voice which speaks for the source of the subject also make claims on the object of aesthetic judgment? Dare we to say what an object “should” be aesthetically? When we return to our prior discussion of the object, we see that it, just as much as the subject, emerges from emptiness to exist for a short time. As the word _sonzai_ implies, this existence is a spatiotemporally rooted struggle against impermanence. Therefore, the voice which speaks to me as the source of my being also has authority to speak to the object as the source of its being. As we said in the last chapter, for Watsuji, ethical good is the continual growth and development of the cycle of double negation, hence the aesthetic good is the growth and development of a harmony between the negation of distancing and the negation of dissolution. An aesthetic object is good insofar as it is able to participate in the development of such a harmony.

###Forming aesthetic judgments
We have seen that the basis of normativity in aesthetic judgment is the mutual emergence of the subject and object of judgment from emptiness. However, the actual process of concretely forming a judgment remains to be brought into sharper focus. In the last chapter, we quoted from Watsuji’s unfinished notes on art theory:

> In this sense, the aesthetic appreciator can be said to be an appreciator who “contemplates the fullness (German, *[Fülle][de]*) of the object without interest (German, *[uninteressiert][de]*)” as Moritz Geiger says. (WTZ B1:145)

The notion of the “fullness” of the object needs to be explored in further depth. How can we judge the fullness of an object? In the case of art objects, Watsuji mentions two criteria which recur in German theories of aesthetics: 

> *art works are made by human beings*. Hence the artist’s *[Wollen][de]* (German, “will”) and *[Können][de]* (“ability”) are in them. To the extent that artists are human beings, whoever they are it could not be the case that their *[Wollen][de]* and *[Können][de]* are so deep as to be absolutely beyond our grasp. (WTZ B1:153--4)

This leads us towards a relatively straightforward method for forming an aesthetic judgment. As I see it, the method would roughly be as follows: First, on the basis of knowledge about the circumstances of the production of the work to be evaluated, we infer what sort of active spectator would be suitable to view the work in question according to the original intention (*[Wollen][de]*) of the artist. Second, we do what is necessary to become such a active spectator. (This may involve developing one’s senses, becoming familiar with a canon, engaging with many similar works, prompting oneself in a certain way, or, in extreme cases, changing one’s style of life or values, etc.) Third, we experience the work from the vantage point of the suitable spectator and see what sort of aesthetic experiences can be produced on the basis of the work as an object. Fourth, we evaluate the execution of the artist (*[Können][de]*) according to how well the work was able to achieve the aims set beforehand. Finally, it may be necessary on the basis of what is revealed by the prior evaluation of the work to revise one’s view of suitable spectator for the work by returning to the first step, reevaluating the life of the artist, reengaging in the cultivation of suitability as spectator, and iteratively continuing the process of evaluation indefinitely in a hermeneutic cycle. Hence the judgment, “this is beautiful,” can be taken to mean something like, “this will be seen as beautiful should one approach it in a suitable manner.” The fullness of an art object in this case consists of its ability to live up to the intentions which caused it to come into being.

The difficulty with this approach, as Watsuji points out in the same set of notes, is that not all aesthetic experiences are had in relation to works of art. We also have aesthetic experience of nature. However, judging those experiences is difficult because nature lacks something as straightforward as an artist’s intention to evaluate it in light of. Watsuji remarks, “towards nature any *[Einstellung][de]* (German, attitude) is permitted” (WTZ B1:154), hence settling on a suitable manner from which to approach the object is significantly complicated. This in turn complicates the identification and assessment of the fullness of the object. On the other hand, Watsuji remarks that “nature is an unfathomably infinite fountain. As our eyes deepen, so deepens nature” (WTZ B1:153). That is, the more refined our understanding of nature becomes, the more nature presents for us to understand. The more we attune ourselves to the beauty of nature, the more beauty there is to uncover. That natural objects possess fullness is prima facie evident. The difficulty is in their assessment, but since natural objects emerge from the same emptiness as manmade objects, there must be some ground on which to form appropriate judgments of them.

In _Study of Ethics_, we read that, “The highest value is an absolute totality, and an ‘aspiration’ [English in the original] (an upward impulse or fervent wish) for it is ‘good’ (_zen_ [善][ja])” (WTZ 10:142) and this applies as much to natural objects as manmade. Objects in general can express harmony (in Japanese, _wa_ [和][ja]) through their interrelation of part and whole into an organic unity that brings the many into a new phase of higher value without eliminating the parts. Emptiness is what allows objects to overflow any attempt to reductively capture them from a top-down or a bottom-up direction. There are two ways that this can be seen. Objects can become on the one hand a source of dissatisfaction because we attempt to fix them in place; however, conversely objects are able on the other hand to be a source of satisfaction, when we are able to approach them in such a way that we allow them to be what they will be. Aesthetic judgment, then, is a process by which we assess the harmonization of objects. In the art world, we assess this harmonization against the background of ongoing projects in the social construction of art history. In the natural world, we assess this harmonization by becoming sensitive to the “motives” of the things themselves (though of course, the social construction of the subject plays an important role in how capable we are of mustering such sensitivity). We enter into the world of objects without either assimilating them to ourselves or entirely surrendering our own selves to them. Instead we ecstatically experience the fullness of things in the mode of ex-sistere. 

Of course, this discussion of the mechanics of aesthetic judgment is still somewhat more abstract than one might like. However, further specification of aesthetic judgment cannot be made in the absence of consideration of the subject which will be making the judgment. In the language of Arthur Danto, we need to specify the “art world” that will be judging the object and the “aesthetic predicates” which are significant within that art world. This is not to totally relativize aesthetic judgment. As stated above, the ecstatic assessment of the fullness of things cannot be divorced from aesthetic judgment, whatever specific form it takes. Nevertheless, a more concrete explanation of such judgment will require a concrete background against which to explicate it.

###Concrete examples of aesthetic judgment as the meeting point of spirit
####Traditional Japanese art forms
In summary, the key to aesthetic judgment is the meeting point of feeling. In the case of art objects, the embodied subjects of the artist and the audience meet to form a community of taste. They establish norms and principles based on their mutual interaction and disinterested enjoyment of the object. The object as well, in art and nature, meets the subject and calls it out of itself into an ecstatic experience of the common ground between them. Judgment is rendered on the basis of the overall harmony felt when meeting with a loving empathy.

Still, nature of aesthetic judgment will be more clear if we can examine some specific examples. In _Milieu_, Watsuji observes that the meeting point of feeling is central to many of the traditional Japanese arts. While I wish to contend that the meeting point of spirit is central to all forms of aesthetic judgment, not just those in the traditional arts of Japan, nevertheless, the examples he gives provide a vividly demonstration of the structure I have been arguing for.

On such example is the traditional Japanese garden. Unlike English gardens which prize artificiality and symmetry, Japanese gardens tend towards an asymmetry which mimics the spontaneity nature yet is achieved through careful control. Watsuji writes,

> Here is a unity gained not by geometrical proportions but by a balancing of forces which appeals to the emotions, a unity of a meeting of spirit. Just as spirits meet between man and man, so do they also meet between moss and stone or even between stone and stone. Every effort is made to avoid the orderly in order to achieve this “meeting of spirit”. 192§

The aesthetic judgment of a Japanese garden rests on the feeling that every element has a harmonious place within the greater whole. Each stone is placed is relation to every other stone, yet without imposing a rigidly geometrical concept of order.

Similarly, traditional Japanese ink paintings, called *sumi-e* [墨絵][ja] or *suiboku* [水墨][ja] in Japanese, favor asymmetry over symmetry, yet the tonality of the composition of the whole must be very delicately balanced to allow the elements to form a greater harmony:

> the composition of a painting of this kind one can recognise no symmetry in any sense
of the word, yet there is a sense of balance that reaches through
the whole canvas; the surface left unpainted, wide and deep, balances with the dark shade of the sparrow and the power in the latter corresponds to that in the two or three bamboo leaves that are drawn particularly forcefully and prominently. Thus each of the components .has its essential position which is not to be altered. Through this connection of balance, this meeting of spirit, even a painting of this nature, with only one corner actually filled, gives a feeling of great richness of composition. 193--4

The rich feeling of the painting comes from the way that the viewer can perceive the creativity and spontaneity of the artist's brush just by looking. Each stroke is present and perfectly positioned, yet no simple, mechanical rule underlies their placement:

> This well-measured balance may well be clear at a single glance, but we can discover no order or rule lying at the root of this delicacy of measure; it was achieved intuitively and it is a “meeting of feeling” that would disappear with the difference of a mere inch. 194§

Our examples can be further multiplied since as Watsuji writes, "This characteristic can be discovered also in the No, in the tea-ceremony and in Kabuki, all of them arts born of a "meeting of feel- ing·'." 197§ Why does Watsuji emphasize the importance of asymmetry to the meeting point of feeling? A naïve reading is that the blank spaces in one's garden, painting, and so forth represent "emptiness." William Lafleur considers this interpretation of Watsuji in "Buddhist Emptiness in the Ethics and Aesthetics of Watsuji Tetsurō," but rejects it:

> Exactly what he means here by 'the moment of negation' is the critical point. My argument will be that he does not simply mean that these arts have as a characteristic of them what is sometimes called 'negative expression' -
> that is, the prolonged silences and empty spaces that can be found in them. That is, they do not simply provide uswith some kind of aesthetic embodi mentofjno'v,theNihil,orontologicalnegation.Watsuji,Ithink,hasamore
> sophisticated view and in it themeaning of 'negation' is intimately linked to the notion of emptiness as co-dependent origination.

The more sophisticated view that Watsuji is trying to express is, according to Lafluer, about the dynamism of emptiness:

> If we ask how this advances our understanding of Buddhist emptiness, we need at the outset to reject an interpretation which recommends itself as obvious but is, in fact,wrong andmisleading. As was suggested above, we may not identify emptiness with some kind of non-being which has been reified and now hasmanaged tobemirrored by and through blank spaces on an artist's canvas. Such an interpretation would not only involve a facile mimeticism but would also involve a fundamental misunderstanding of the meaning of emptiness. ForWatsuji's point about the void on the canvas is not that it
> makes palpable and concrete something metaphysical called 'non-being' but that it operates tomake possible a series of relationships and reciprocities.

Sakai criticized Watsuji's emptiness as "reductive" of the subject, but the use of emptiness in Japanese art shows that the meaning of emptiness is just the opposite of reduction. Emptiness overflows in value, filling the garden or canvas, etc. with life. Hence, Lafluer argues, the real meaning of rejecting symmetry lies in the mutuality of relations with others. A father and son, for example, §§§

> But then why does the art so conspicuously avoid and reject any repre sentation through symmetry? The reason is, f think, that inWatsuji's view co-dependence is dynamic and multiple rather than static and single. In formal symmetry the balance and reciprocity is limited to the single and exact counterpart of a line, angle, or whatever. The observer can always designate theformal counterpart. But in the notion of emptiness there is reciprocity between forms and entities which are in no way mirror-images
> of each other. The mutuality is total even between rocks and moss, what is vast and what isminuscule. This mutuality is also open-ended and multiple. Surely it isone forwhich the formalized and objectified balance achieved in
> 'symmetry' is inadequate.3

- Hence the criticism Mayeda makes is kinda baffling.
- Sakai at 113--4 talks about “symmetrical reciprocity” but I can’t tell why.


####The interconnection of subjects in _renga_
  - Importance of community, context§

An example of the meeting point of spirit worthy of an extended examination can be found in Japanese linked verse or _renga_ [連歌][ja], about which Watsuji explains,

> Each verse in a linked poem has its own independent existence, yet there is a subtle link which unites these so that one existence evolves into another and there is an order which reaches through the whole. 196§

Linked verse is by its nature a collaborative process governed by the chances product of many imaginations rather than a single vision from a lead poet. In it, each poet contributes a verse which connects to the verse immediately before it, but not necessarily in continuity with the poem before that. Through this process, a group of poets would spend the evening creating a kaleidoscopic aesthetic performance in which the perspective of each poem shifts radically when read in juxtaposition with the poem after it rather than before it.  Nevertheless, we do find something that connects these poems together while showing the individuality of the various authors. Watsuji asks,

> Yet how can such chance create artistic unity? Here again the answer lies in “meeting of feeling,” in this case a meeting of the heart. If there is no meeting between the tempers of a gathering of poets, no surpassing linked verse will come of the gathering. While preserving their own individuality, the poets combine their feelings and reveal their individual experience in a symphonic concord of each other’s hearts. (196)

The aesthetic judgment of the participants clearly requires a certain frame of mind which can unite them in spite of their differences, and that this frame of mind can exist at all reveals to us the twofold nature of the human subject as both individual and collective. Because the human being is both individual and collective, linked verse is able to show the personality of its many collaborators both individually and collectively without having to negate one for the sake of the other. The structure of the linked verse meeting provides the authors with detachment from their ordinary concerns but their appreciation for their mutually crafted verses allows them to express their hearts openly in a “symphonic concord” of merging perspectives.

> Objects seeming to have no conceivable connection in the matter of
content are linked one with another in accordance with associations §196
in the words themselves. This is truly the extreme of illogicality in comparison with the picture given where content provides a logical thread. Yet this marshalling of words according to an association of ideas does make one sense a strong flavour of compositional unity in the whole, for even though there may be no link of intellectual
content between words, yet they are threaded together by emotional content.§197
>
> This kind of pointillism by the word is likewise made possible not by a logical thread perceived in intellectual content but by a linking of the words that is felt in this
"meeting of feeling". §197


One incident in the life of the *renga* poet Bashō ([芭蕉][ja], §§--§§) illustrates a key aspect of aesthetic judgment. One time a dispute arose about the proper interpretation of his disciple Kyorai’s poem, “On the edge of this rock, / Here is one more / Moon-viewer”:

> Kyorai said, “Shadō asserted that this must be a monkey, but what I intend is another person.” Bashō retorted, “A monkey! What does he mean? What were you thinking when you composed the poem?” Kyorai answered, “As I was walking over the fields and mountains, singing under the light of the full moon, I found, on the edge of a rock, another man filled with poetical excitement.” Bashō said, “In the phrase, ‘There is one more person,’ you announce yourself; in this there is poetry.” […] My poetical taste is below the highest, but in Bashō’s interpretation, there is something fantastic, I think.[^]

[^]: From Blyth, R. H. _Haiku. Volume I: Eastern Culture_. Paperback edition. Tokyo: Hokuseido Press, 1981, p. 343.

About this incident, the translator R.H. Blyth remarks, “we have here the entertaining picture of Bashō telling Kyorai, not what he ought to have said, but what he ought to have meant by what he said” (343). Why is Bashō’s interpretation preferred over Kyorai’s? What is the source of his authority? As the master of Kyorai, Bashō is in a position to offer an authoritative interpretation of Kyorai’s work. Through a lifetime of training, Bashō has made himself able to instantly size up the merits of a haiku. He is able to speak for the poetic betweenness in which they operate. At the same time, one of the reasons that it is Bashō and not someone else who is in that position is that Kyorai as the author had always intended for the poem to be evaluated for someone with the degree of insight that he considered his master to have. Thus, as an author, Kyorai has the authority to invest Bashō with a claim to the authoritative interpretation. Bashō is the “ideal observer” or “suitable spectator” for the poem because he has cultivated his taste to its utmost. But notice that the judgment that Bashō achieved came not through passive contemplation or reflection but through a lifetime of embodied engagement in the poetic arts. Thus, it is better to describe Bashō not as “ideal observer” but as an “authoritative agent.” The connoisseur must be in some sense an accomplished creator who enacts their artistry as an expression of the betweenness out of which the artistic community emerges.

Notice also Bashō’s interpretation of the poem: “In the phrase, ‘There is one more person,’ you announce yourself.” The experience of this verse also fits within the structure of detachment and ecstasy. “On the edge of this rock” introduces the scene with detachment. From a distance, the poet is observing a far off mountain peak. Then the poet writes, “There is one more.” From a detached perspective, this merely introduces another object of contemplation. But as Bashō recognizes, the detached perspective must now gain greater depth through its reflexivity. There is one more on the mountain, and I am on the mountain. This leads inexorably to the moment of aesthetic appreciation in which the difference between the poet’s self and the other on the peak are given union in a broader context: they are all moon-viewers, even the edge of the rock. In the moment of the aesthetic judgment, the subject expands to encompass everything, but the authority§ to speak for that subject is invested foremost in one who has cultivated the ability actively crystalize such moments.

- Hon’i vs. shii: Has to be here, to explain why hon’i are normative and how the subject is a field.§
- Re: also emotion in Japanese verse. The scene “contains” the emotion already. Isn’t that absurd though? No, because the containing is about an active engagement of subject and object, not a passive reception of the object by the subject. Hence Watsuji’s aesthetics are a re-descriptive of Japanese history not accidentally or insidiously but essentially since re-description is what we do when we do aesthetics.

One of the central considerations for any poet in that period of Japanese history was a poem’s connection to the _hon’i_ ([本意][ja]) or “root implications” of the situation versus merely private implications (_shii_ [私意][ja]). [Kōji][sc] Kawamoto explains in _The Poetics of Japanese Verse_ that certain poetic images had, in the course of Japanese literary history, developed certain fixed associations. For example, the autumn dusk is forlorn, hence this verse by Bashō:

> [この道や / 行く人なしに / 秋のくれ][ja]<br/>
> <br/>
> _Kono michi ya / yuku hito nashi ni / aki no kure_<br/>
> <br/>
> This path / is without a traveller / at the autumn dusk.

In this verse, Bashō is doing several things simultaneously. Concretely, he observes the lonesome emptiness of the path he walks. Abstractly, he complains that few follow the Way or Dao [道][zh] to which he has dedicated his life. Literally, he connects himself into a long tradition of poetry about the lonesomeness of the evening in autumn. The overall effect of the verse comes from the interpenetration of these aspects in a single moment of time. 

さびしさの うれしくもあり 秋の暮れ
sabishisa no ureshiku mo ari aki no kure
Yosa Buson (與謝蕪村)

Kawamoto explains, 

>_Hon’i_ is usually explained as the essential qualities inherent in an object and the emotional response deemed appropriate. However, […] the actual qualities of the phenomenon itself were second to the conceptual qualities acquired through literary precedent. To give a twist to Oscar Wilde’s famous remark […], there may have been autumn dusks for centuries in Japan, but no one saw them until the age of the _Shinkokinshū_ (ca. 1210), when the theme of autumn evening began to attract markedly strong interest.[^]

[^]: Kawamoto, p. 61. Oscar Wilde’s famous remark is “There may have been fogs for centuries in London. I dare say there were. But no one saw them, and so we do not know anything about them. They did not exist till Art had invented them” (Kawamoto 10).

For Bashō and other Japanese poets, the aim of poetry is the kind of naturalness that arises when things are able to express themselves as they are, including emotionally. Hattori Dohō ([服部土芳][ja], 1657--1730), one of Bashō’s students, records in _Sanzōshi_ [三冊子][ja]: “ ‘Learn of the pine from the pine; learn of the bamboo from the bamboo.’ These words of our Master mean to distance oneself from private implications ([私意][ja] _shii_).”[^] In other words, when Bashō writes emotionally charged poems about the world, he takes it that these poems are not drawing from any private or subjective emotional associations with things in the world (_shii_), but from a proper understanding of the emotionality embedded in the world (_hon’i_).

Another example of _hon’i_ of things comes from Bashō's _Oku no Hosomichi_ [奥の細道][ja] (_The Narrow Path to the Interior_):

> [行春や / 鳥啼魚の / 目は泪][ja]<br/>
> <br/>
> _Yuku haru ya / tori naki uo no / me wa namida_<br/>
> <br/>
> Passing spring: / the birds cry and the fish / have eyes full of tears.

Formally speaking, the poem consists of two parts divided by the cutting word _ya_. In the first, the poet invokes the passing spring. Earlier Japanese poets had created an association between grief over the changing of the seasons and the crying of birds (Kawamoto 84--5).  One source of this association is the poem “Spring Prospects” (_Chun Wang_ [春望][zh]) by Du Fu ([杜甫][zh], 712--770), which reads, in part: 

> [國破山河在，城春草木深。感時花濺淚，恨別鳥驚心。][zh] >
> The nation shattered, mountains and rivers remain;<br />
> city in spring, grass and trees burgeoning.<br />
> Feeling the times, blossoms draw tears;<br />
> hating separation, birds alarm the heart” (Watson 30). 


Here we can see the core elements that Bashō’s poem has refashioned to capture his experience: spring, tears, separation, and birds. The only missing element are the fish. In general, Bashō’s writing often skillfully refashioned Chinese and Japanese sources to give them a personal twist

In the second part of the poem, we are given a concrete image of spring’s passing that relies on this association. In Japanese, both the singing of birds and the mourning of humans are called _naki_ (crying), and Bashō has played up this ambiguity by writing _naki_ with the character 啼, which can have either meaning, rather than using 泣, which specifically means mourning, or 鳴, which specifically means birdsong. Within the narrative context of _The Narrow Road to Oku_, we form a mental picture of Bashō as he and his disciple leave to begin their long journey. Bashō explains: “I set out after composing this verse, the first of my journey, but I could barely keeping going ahead, for when I looked back I saw my friends standing in a row, no doubt to watch until we were lost to sight” (Keene 23).

Reading this, some critics might suggest that the concreteness of the poem’s imagery is undercut by Bashō’s strong emotional response. As Japanese literature critic Haruo Shirane notes in _Traces of Dreams_, the birds and fish seem to “mourn the passing of the spring, and by implication the departure of the traveler” (247). Yet, a critic might claim, this is surely impossible for birds and fish. Moreover, some commentators take the poem as perhaps representing travellers by the passing spring or allegorically identifying the disciples left behind with the fish and the departing Bashō and Sora with the birds (Shirane 247). Other scholars interpret the image of the fish’s tears more literally by seeing them as beads of water on fish in a fishmonger’s shop (Kawamoto 85). 

Kawamoto notes that _hon’i_ are difficult to categorize using traditional Western schemes of classification since they are neither clearly subjective nor clearly objective (2--4). Kawamoto explains,

> Bashō is saying that poetic truth can only be achieved through a sympathetic and selfless faith in the traditions of the past. As the boundary between the one who sees and the object seen grows weak, the two are fused, and the division into subject and object becomes meaningless. (65)

_Hon’i_ seem on the surface to be in between these two categories since they are imputed by “us,” not individually but collectively, and are not based on a particular impression but on a normative cultural construct---_hon’i_ are what one _should_ feel in a given situation. Indeed, the Japanese poets would insist that a fact about the autumn sunset was revealed when it came to be associated with a sense of forlornness, and a fact about the passing spring was revealed when they came to associate it with the calling birds. These associations are just as normative as the causal associations that force us to think of the second billiard ball rolling away when see the first about to impact it. In the case of Japanese literature, it is just that the object of association is emotional rather than physical. Nevertheless, in spite of the emotionality and subjectivity of these associations, they are not merely idiosyncratic. 

When we interpret Bashō’s poem from the perspective of the _hon’i_, we see that he is not projecting his own sorrow onto the birds and fish. To the contrary, because of his immersion in his native poetic tradition, he is able to see the resonance between his individual grief and the larger grief which arises out of the situation itself. It was his own grief at leaving that provided a gateway for Bashō to step through and feel correctly the pathos inherent to the situation. Just as one can only see the beauty of the sunrise if some stimulus wakes one up early in the morning, in order to understand the passing of the spring, Bashō had to find himself in a context in which his grief acted as a stimulus that awoke him to the deeper grief of the passing of spring. His own grief is what awoke him, but what he saw once awake was something outside of himself: the fullness of the object as he and it arise from emptiness.

###Concluding remarks on the subject/object problem
  - Is comedy objective or subjective?
  - When I say, “This ice cream is delicious,” am I telling you about the ice cream or about me?
    “Plausibly, it could be either depending on circumstances. Imagine I’m picking out ice cream for my birthday party. In that case, I want ice cream that suits me. On the other hand, suppose I am picking out ice cream for someone else’s birthday party. In that case, I am guessing what the birthday boy and guests will like (Which is a fact about the ice cream somehow? It has the property of BEING LIKABLE??).”
