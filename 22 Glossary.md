- _Jian_ [間][zh] --- An interval, space, or realm.

- _Li_ [禮][zh] --- Ritual propriety, rites, ritual action, etiquette, manners. A central virtue in Confucianism, _li_ is at once the attitude one is supposed to take during ritual action and the ritual action itself.

- _Liang_ [良][zh] --- Well functioning, instrumentally good.

- _Liangxin_ [良心][zh] --- “Conscience” in modern Chinese. Literally, good functioning of heart-mind. In _Mencius_ 6A.8, Mencius explains that we are all born with a good heart that will allow us to distinguish right from wrong, but only some of us preserve and grow the seeds of this ability. 

- _Lun_ [倫][zh] --- Human relationships.

- _Mei_ [美][zh] --- Beautiful, attractive, or excellent. Note that there is no tendency in ancient texts to treat _mei_ as a freestanding abstract “Beauty.”

* _Nei_ [內][zh] --- Inside as opposed to outside (_wai_ [外][zh]). Groups closer to oneself as opposed to further. Various Mencian scholars have taken the precise sense of internality debated in *Mencius* 6A differently, but most likely it involves those tastes that are individually, subjectively, and emotionally determined rather than those that are determined by a fixed, non-emotive procedure. See Shun, 94--112.

- _Tong_ [同][zh] --- Sameness, uniformity, or identity.

* _Wai_ [外][zh] --- External. See _nei_ [內][zh].

- _Yi_ [義][zh] --- A sense of moral appropriateness. Sometimes translated as “duty” or “righteousness,” but these translations fail to convey its psychological aspect or flexibility.
