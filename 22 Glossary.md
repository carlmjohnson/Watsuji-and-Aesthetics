##Glossary
###Chinese terms
Terms are sorted according to the pinyin romanization of modern standard Mandarin, but definitions are classical unless otherwise noted. 

- _Ai_ [愛][zh] --- Possessive love. To treat something sparingly. Affective concern.

- _Ben_ [本][zh] --- Root. Often erroneously translated as "original."

- _Cibei_ [慈悲][zh] --- Buddhist compassion. Used to translate Sanskrit *[karuṇā][sa]* and Pāli *[metti][pi]*.

- _Cun_ [存][zh] --- To preserve against loss over time.

- _Dao_ [道][zh] --- A way, a path, walking a path, making a path, a method, or explaining a method.

- _De_ [德][zh] --- Excellence, virtue, insistent particularity.

- _He_ [和][zh] --- Harmony. According to _Analects_ 13.23, it is superior to mere conformity (_tong_ [同][zh]).

- _Jian_ [間][zh] --- An interval, space, or realm.

- _Li_ [禮][zh] --- Ritual propriety, rites, ritual action, etiquette, manners. A central virtue in Confucianism, _li_ is at once the attitude one is supposed to take during ritual action and the ritual action itself.

- _Lian_ [戀][zh] --- Romantic love.

- _Liang_ [良][zh] --- Well functioning, instrumentally good.

- _Liangxin_ [良心][zh] --- “Conscience” in modern Chinese. Literally, good functioning of heart-mind. In _Mencius_ 6A.8, Mencius explains that we are all born with a good heart that will allow us to distinguish right from wrong, but only some of us preserve and grow the seeds of this ability. 

- _Lun_ [倫][zh] --- Human relationships.

- _Mei_ [美][zh] --- Beautiful, attractive, or excellent. Note that there is no tendency in ancient texts to treat _mei_ as a freestanding abstract “Beauty.”

* _Nei_ [內][zh] --- Inside as opposed to outside (_wai_ [外][zh]). Groups closer to oneself as opposed to further. Various Mencian scholars have taken the precise sense of internality debated in *Mencius* 6A differently, but most likely it involves those tastes that are individually, subjectively, and emotionally determined rather than those that are determined by a fixed, non-emotive procedure. See Shun, 94--112.

- _Qi_ [氣][zh] --- Air, breath, vital energy, or spirit. The hylozoistic, processual “stuff” making up the world in Chinese cosmology.

- _Ren_ [人][zh] --- A person, human beings, or member of society.

- _Ren_ [仁][zh] --- Humane, benevolent, noble, or authoritative conduct. The graph is a person and the number two, indicating sociability. Note its homophony with _ren_ [人][zh] (“person”), which is also attested to in the earliest reconstructed pronunciations.

- _Ti_ [體][zh] or [体][zh] --- The body. Counterposed with _jian_ [兼][zh], it means “unit” as opposed to “whole.” Counterposed with _yong_ [用][zh], it means the “matter” as opposed to the “functioning.”

- _Tong_ [同][zh] --- Sameness, uniformity, or identity.

* _Wai_ [外][zh] --- External. See _nei_ [內][zh].

- _Xin_ [心][zh] --- The heart-and-mind. Unlike the English “heart” and “mind,” _xin_ is both rational and emotive.

- _Yang_ [陽][zh] --- The bright side of a hill. By extension, things associated with light, masculinity, and height.

- _Yi_ [義][zh] --- A sense of moral appropriateness. Sometimes translated as “duty” or "righteousness," but these translations fail to convey its psychological aspect or flexibility.

- _Yin_ [陰][zh] --- The dark side of a hill. By extension, things associated with darkness, femininity, and depth.

- _You_ [有][zh] --- Having, possessing, being, or existence. The graph is a picture of a hand holding a piece of meat.
